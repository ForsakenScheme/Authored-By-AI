\subsection{Purpose of ABAI}
In a world where generative AI has been made available to the public (in the shape of various tools), demand for a tool capable of authorship attribution has emerged. Authorship attribution is the task of identifying the author of a given text. ABAI was created specifically for this purpose. It will assist you in identifying the source of a certain piece of text.
