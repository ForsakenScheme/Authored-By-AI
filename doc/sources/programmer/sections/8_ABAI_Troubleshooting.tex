\subsection{Pip is not recognized as internal/external command}
\textbf{Error Message:} This error occurs when \texttt{pip} is not in your PATH environment variable. You can try the following instructions to solve this problem:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If you are running Linux, try using \texttt{pip3} instead of \texttt{pip}.
    \item Add \texttt{pip} to your PATH environment variable by following this \href{https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-  pip-on-windows/}{tutorial}.
    \item Reinstall Python and \texttt{pip}.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{WSL not supported}
The error message indicates that your Windows machine is not able to run WSL. This could be caused by a \textbf{disabled Windows feature} called “Virtual Machine Platform”. WSL depends on it. And in turn, Docker Desktop depends on WSL.
