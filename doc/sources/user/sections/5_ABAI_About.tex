\label{subsec:License}
\subsubsection{Can I redistribute the application ?}
Yes, you can redistribute the application even under another license, but you must be cautious about how you handle the GPL3-licensed Python module. The GPL3 license requires that any derivative work or modifications made to the GPL3-licensed module must also be licensed under the GPL3 or a compatible license. Therefore, if your modifications are to the GPL3-licensed module itself, those modifications must also be released under the GPL3 license.
\subsubsection{Can I modify the application?}
Yes, you can modify the application, but again, you need to consider the implications of the GPL3 license for the module. If your modifications are limited to the MIT-licensed parts of the application and do not involve modifications to the GPL3-licensed module, then you are free to modify the MIT-licensed portions as you see fit. However, if your modifications extend to the GPL3-licensed module, those modifications must comply with the GPL3 license terms, including the requirement to release the modified code under the GPL3 or a compatible license.
