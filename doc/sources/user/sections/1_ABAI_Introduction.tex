\subsection{Purpose of ABAI}
In a world where generative AI has been made available to the public (in the shape of various tools), demand for a tool capable of authorship attribution has emerged. Authorship attribution is the task of identifying the author of a given text. ABAI was created specifically for this purpose. It will assist you in identifying the source of a certain piece of text.

\subsection{Main features}
 Once provided with correct text data, Authored by AI will be capable of detecting whether a particular piece of text has been written by a human author, or whether it has been generated by a generative AI model (ChatGPT). The tool itself is powered by a machine learning model.
 
\subsection{The scope}
ABAI in it's current state has been trained on datasets of raw essays of various subjects. Even though it can be used to cover a vast majority of subjects, it will perform best on texts structured and shaped similarly to those used during training. ABAI will not verify if the input given to it has the correct structure. It will also not perform any language checks. Please be sure to provide correct data and structure it according to the examples provided with the program. 

\subsection{What is ABAI's audience?}
ABAI has been built with the following purpose in mind : detect if a student has made use of generative AI to generate an essay answer to a given prompt for a school project or exercise. The essay to be analyzed will be sliced into different paragraphs as to determine whether a certain paragraph has more odds to have been generated by generative AI. \\

As the trend of generative AI keeps rising, this feature could prove itself essential to have in one's toolbox while assessing a piece of writing.\\

No specific prior knowledge in the field of machine learning or text analysis is needed for basic usage of the tool. However, a basic level of knowledge about machine learning parameter selection could be beneficial for a more advanced and customized usage on the local user interface of the application.\\
