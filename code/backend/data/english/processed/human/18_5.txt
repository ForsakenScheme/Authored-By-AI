Also, Prunier gives us ample amounts of information regarding important political figures and organizations, something that is crucial to our understanding of the article. While he simply could have said "the international community was indifferent", he instead chooses to show us, by discussing the United States' brief, transient interest in the situation (until our attention was diverted by more, "important" matters), the French ulterior motive for preserving a neighboring regime, and the rest of the developed world's "we don't really care" donations, constant bickering, and pointless racket. Although this vast confusion of names, dates, historical facts, is overwhelming at first, I laud the author for his great attention to detail on the situation, something an average, uninformed audience would fail to appreciate.
