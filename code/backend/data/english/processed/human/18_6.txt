In addition to supporting Prunier's stance that we (the developed world) should actively intervene in the Darfur Crisis, I also believe that the United States needs to live up to the paternal reputation it has built up for itself. While some isolationists here and abroad argue that the United States mind its own business and not meddle continuously in international affairs, I believe that our past decisions to do so, such as our involvement in both world wars, the Vietnam War, the declaration of war against Iraq, have set the precedent for a long time to come, and since we have remained a world leader for at least a century, we should not disappoint. For most of our history, the U.S. has always been eager and willing to lend a hand to countries in political and economic turmoil; even those that hated us, including North Korea, received generous amounts of humanitarian aid from our benevolent country. Why, all of a sudden, should we fail to act now? We have always been a very decisive people, and always seem to have an opinion on even the most trivial of issues (to the annoyance of the rest of the world), but why are we now reluctant to intervene on behalf of the oppressed Darfuris?
