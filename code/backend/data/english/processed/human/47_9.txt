Throughout the novel, Harper Lee suggested that moral courage is the ideal trait to be valued. True enough, moral courage has been a significant help to cure the hell that people give each other in Maycomb society. In the case of Tom Robinson, it was as clear as daylight for Atticus that there was no way he could win the trial for Tom, but his moral courage was the only hope for Tom and the Black society for the truth to be told and for justice. Atticus suffered personally beyond worrying for his children's emotional and moral development or being spat on by Bob Ewell, which even Aunt Alexandra could realise: "He doesn't show much, but it tears him down into pieces". With his moral courage, in making the justice think about the case, Atticus managed to fight for his personal principle of justice. He did not win, as expected; Tom Robinson had to sacrifice his life for no reason. However, in truth, Atticus won this trial the moment he made the jury consider whether Tom was really guilty. On the surface, he lost the trial, but the truth is, Atticus brought Maycomb a "baby-step" closer to being a fair and humane society. Atticus could do what many people in Maycomb longed for, yet dared not to raise their voice against the prejudiced norms of the county. With his moral courage, Atticus had set the base for a better world, where there is no place for discrimination. He had received victory.
