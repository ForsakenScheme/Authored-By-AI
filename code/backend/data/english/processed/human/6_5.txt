It may be necessary to go back to the library and look for specific journal articles or books for the specific focus that you will be taking from the thesis. Create some note cards with quotes, but always be sure to cite where you got the information including the author, title of the article, journal, date, volume, and page numbers. Use the outline to choose the material to create note cards on. Once you finish the research, it will be time to create a rough draft.
