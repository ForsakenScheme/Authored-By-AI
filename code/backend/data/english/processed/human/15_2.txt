Puberty is a sure indicator that adolescence has arrived although it may begin in a cognitive capacity before physically noticeable. Physical changes and events in Europe needed to occur to allow for the Enlightenment to develop as discussed earlier. Along these lines I would then define the industrial revolution as the pubertal or physical changes necessary for the progression of human development to attain adolescence or Enlightenment. For example physical changes during puberty such as hormone levels changing creates emotional instability, a defining characteristic of adolescence. Just as technological advances or changes during the industrial revolution plowed a pathway for Enlightenment thinkers to question authority through widely read literature.
