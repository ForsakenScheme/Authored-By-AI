Marrakech is a city in Southwestern Morocco in the foothills of the Atlas Mountains. It is also the title of Orwell's essay "Marrakech," in which he wastes little time revealing his narrow-mindedness toward the colonized. It begins with Orwell watching a funeral procession where he observes flies surrounding the dead body. He notes the fact that the dead body is not in a casket but rather "merely wrapped in a piece of rag," insinuating that the colonized are barbaric. He then belittles their burying ground and says that it's "merely a huge waste of hummocky earth, like a derelict building-lot." Orwell continues his prejudice and says that the colonized are "undifferentiated brown stuff" and that no one notices them when their alive, and worse still, remembers them when their dead. Orwell does however, notice "the overloading of donkeys and [is] infuriated by it" instead of noticing the overworked, undernourished colonized. Orwell is disgusted "when [he sees] how the people live, and still more how easily they die," and he thinks of them as something other than human when he says that he finds it "difficult to believe that [he is] walking among human beings."
