This movie is not well known for being an action flick. That makes it even more surprising for me to actually like it, and recommend it to someone. Taking place in the early 1930s, Road to Perdition is an early mob/mafia movie. It has got its fair share of bloodshed along with intense moments that seemingly pull you off the edge of your seat. Jude Law plays Maguire, a hired hit man sent to eliminate Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) and his son, Michael Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin.) At one point in the movie, Michael and Maguire are talking in a friendly with each other at a diner. Maguire pulls out a camera and loads the film in it. Michael begins to ask, "Is that uh, your profession? Or pleasure?" Maguire finishes loading the film in the camera, while explaining that he does it for both business and pleasure. He places the camera on the table facing directly towards Michael. Maguire then inquires, "Yourself?" to ask what Michael does for a living. Michael makes a hasty lie that he machines parts for a living. Michael proceeds to question Maguire further as to what his profession is. "I'm press..." Maguire says. "I'm somewhat of a rarity. I shoot the dead!" This is when Michael begins to sweat. He now knows he is face to face with a man set out to kill him. Maguire is a photographer that takes pictures of dead people, and now his camera is facing Michael. Michael then bluffs that the food doesn't agree with him and heads to the bathroom. Once inside he jumps out the window, slashes the tires on Maguire's car, then finally make a break for it driving off into the night. (The Road to Perdition) - I wondered if he just left his son there, then realized that the son wasn't in the scene. You might want to make this clearer, or just not mention the son at this point.
