The author feels that the building of the dam has destroyed the river's natural beauty and wonder. He is "Poorly and impressed by the concrete aggregates and statistics in the cubic tons." I understand the author's point of view, but does he really truly understand the effects of other sources of power? Even tells the readers that think he is exaggerating, to take a trip on the river below the dam. He tells them to do this so they can experience nature's beauty. But that does not thoroughly will prove his point. The amount of people living in America is greatly increasing in those people require certain needs, such as power. That power has to come from somewhere, it can either come from a natural source such as a damn or a polluting power plant. Sometimes the negatives outweigh the benefits that something can provide. The author claims there is now an utter baroness of the reservoir shoreline. One could argue to that the baroness is a lot better than a polluted, sewage filled, river were nothing could use it. The author also claims that area used to team with all kinds of wildlife such as songbirds and beavers, before the dam was built. Even the author does not directly state what happened to the wildlife. He says these things are "lost, crowded out - or drowned and buried under mud". The wildlife could have simply relocated when the dam was being built. The author also neglects that the damn may have created a new habitat for wildlife. The fish population greatly increased after the damn was built. Animals and plants have been around longer than people, they are capable of adapting to there surroundings. Nature is capable of amazing things which the author overlooks and he does not give it the credit that it deserves. An example of that adaptation is when a boat sinks, it just does not sit there and wither away, but it's turned into a home for many fish and other creatures. Nature always finds a way.
