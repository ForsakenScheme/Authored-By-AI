Jarratt (1994) expresses that children move through stages of grief productively and the first stage is early grief. This process includes denial, hyperactivity, alarm and panic. These don't come in any particular order but denial is certainly a mechanism that develops early and helps the child to reduce stress and anxiety but also suppresses their feelings helping to support denial. Though the reaction they use is mostly connected to those around the bereaved child. The child might encounter a brief period of shock at first but this is usually overcome by numbness and disbelief. These feelings may give way to intense anxiety or yearning and longing for the deceased.
