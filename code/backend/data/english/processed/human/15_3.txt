The ability to question itself is representative of both adolescence and the Enlightenment, more importantly the ability and practice of questioning authority. For instance a teenager questioning their parents authority of whether or not they should be allowed to stay out later than they were formerly allowed to in terms of development can be compared to those during the enlightenment who questioned governmental authority. For instance Voltaire's comments on the treatment in the Calas case which through logical reasoning Voltaire spoke out against the abuse of unchecked power by the government, which was used to inhumanely punish Calas with lack of regard to court procedure.
