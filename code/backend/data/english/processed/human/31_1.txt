There is nothing like the sense of flipping through a brand new manga. Or perhaps you would call it a "Japanese comic book", a "graphic novel", or even simply "animï". The smell of freshly printed ink ï some far away book store; the soft flutter of clean pages as they brush the tips of fingers; the fluid motion from image to image, page to page. Here are the emotions of an unknown friend, rained down onto the pages before me. And for a moment, I am in awe and admiration of the dedication and pure spirit that went into the work of art.
