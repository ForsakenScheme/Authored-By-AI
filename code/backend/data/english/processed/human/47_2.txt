In a society where men are stereotyped to be brave, these men are expected to show physical courage. Mr. Nathan Radley's shooting at 'niggers', Mr. Avery's risking his life to save Miss Maudie's furniture in the fire and Atticus's shooting the mad dog are just a few instances in which the courage that Maycomb thinks highly of. Even a little child like Scout was aware of this preconception. Only until after Atticus's marksmanship was revealed did Scout stop doubting his manliness and ability as he did not "do anything that could possibly arouse the admiration of anyone." In Maycomb, the image of a man with a shot-gun in his hand, ready to fight has been rooted as the ideal symbol of courage for every single man.
