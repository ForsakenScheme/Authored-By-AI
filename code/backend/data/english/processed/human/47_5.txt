Through out the whole book, Atticus appears to be the role model with moral courage. Given the case of Tom Robinson, Atticus meant to defend him, despite the disapproval of Maycomb County. Atticus had been insulted as "nigger-lover" by lots of people like Francis and Mrs. Dubose; even his sister, Aunt Alexandra had never approved of his choice; but that had never stirred his determination. Atticus knew from the beginning that this war he had to fight against all the White community. He understood that winning the case would be impossible, for it was an open and shut case- when it is between a white man and a black man, the white man would never lose. Despite all that, he went on, determined to protect Tom Robinson, to follow his personal principles.
