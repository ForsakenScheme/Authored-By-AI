First and foremost, Dostoyevsky asserts the notion that people are born with an almost vague evil that is as natural as feeling pain, pleasure, or any other basic urge one may feel. In the beginning of the book, Rodya experiences a heightened sense of guilt and paranoia about his depraved plot to kill the pawnbroker. He agonizes about his unstoppable thoughts saying, "And how could such an atrocious thing come into my head? What filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, filthy above all, disgusting, loathsome, loathsome!--and for a whole month I've been. . ." (8). In this snapshot of Rodya's conscience, Dostoyevsky forms the assertion that "evil" thoughts are inherent and inexorable; a keystone to the human mind that cannot be extracted through sheer force of will. In addition, the author demonstrates that mere acknowledgement of characteristic evil does not dispel it though societal conditioning has branded murder as odiously "unlawful" and everything Rodya has been taught affirms the idea; indeed he sincerely wishes he did not have the thoughts and urges he has, but it comes as a polluted inevitability that vexes his conscience. He physically, mentally, and emotionally cannot stop his criminal fantasies.
