So what does that mean to a student who wishes to try online study? Well, ifyou know you need to be kept on task, don't sign up for an online course. Especially not one without any video lecture component. And if you know that you're the student in class who is always raising his hand to ask a question, then online study probably isn't for you either. You can raise your hand until you lose feeling in your fingers, but chances are, no one can see it to call on you. Nor is there, conversely, anyone to notice when you are falling asleep in class. Unless you're studying in your bed, and that person is your boyfriend/girlfriend. But even the most caring significant other might forget to remind you to "go" to class, so if you are not self-motivated, you probably shouldn't be studying online, either.
