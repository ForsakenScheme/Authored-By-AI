Perhaps you aren't sure if you fit into this second type. The fact is that most students are different, and most will not definitively identify with one group or another. In this case, the individual student must weight he pros and cons and decide for him- or herself which situation is best. Particularly if that student is working full-time and raising three kids. That person might wish to weigh the convenience of online study a bit higher than his or her slight educational preferences. In any case, every student should think carefully before signing up for an online course. Online study can be an invaluable benefit, but if a person isn't suited for the experience, it may be worth giving up your Thursday basket-weaving and going to a "traditional" class.
