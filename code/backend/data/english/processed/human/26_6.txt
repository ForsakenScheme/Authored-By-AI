Finally, in recent years the Security Council has taken a number of steps to increase its efficiency and transparency. These reforms did not stir the amount of controversy as the debate on expansion of the Council has (Global Policy Forum 2005). Today's Council holds more effective public meetings and frequently consults with external non-council actors, including NGO. Furthermore, it publishes its program of work. It has also given other UN members the opportunity to speak before the Council and has made a special effort to enhance relations with troop contributing countries, meeting on a regular basis. In addition, the Council goes on missions to specific areas that are on its agenda. In order to increase the effectiveness of sanctions, Council members have set up a sanctions monitoring mechanism. At the administrative level, the Secretariat has launched a website, which provides easy access to the Council's discussions and decisions (Global Policy Forum 2005).
