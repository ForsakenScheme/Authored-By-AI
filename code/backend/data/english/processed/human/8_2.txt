Recently, one of my assignments was to have others describe my personality. My list had a little of everything, including overt sarcasm ("Really? I never noticed."), my tendency to argue about most anything ("What? I strenuously object!"), a complete lack of tact, and my ever present smile (which another student noted was more of a smirk). A few even had the audacity to state that I am a *softie* at heart (the worst insult possible to a masculine ego). I really can't deny any of these, since they are all integral parts of my persona (with the obvious exception of being a softie). Myself, I prefer to think that they are the result of scientifically inclined thinking combined with near-omnipotent wit. What is sarcasm but witty reply to an unnecessary statement? Playing devil's advocate ensures that I have a healthy supply of arguments (the battles of the mind). And my smirk... well, um... ah... let's just ignore all that and just say that I have a scientific mind.
