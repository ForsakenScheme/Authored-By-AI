The most significant reasons that tempted me into considering law and security administration were the rewards offered by the profession. Firstly, things like character traits, physical fitness, self-respect, self discipline, and courageousness really motivated me into wanting to join. I really wanted to have all these qualities, who wouldn't? Secondly, I looked at things I would need in life out of a job. The salaries and job security in law enforcement intrigued me. In fact, it was more than I was looking for. Also, the experience and desire to succeed was something the job could give me. I viewed this as important. I believed that all people need goals in life, it is a social need. Lastly, this career offered me better retirement in life. I viewed this reward as most important, for this is the last reward that I will acquire from my future career.
