There have been many reasons in my life that influenced me to choose this route. The urge to change things, family tradition, and the desire for personal and financial rewards were the main reasons for my final decision. I have no regrets in my decision; I see my future as only getting better with many more important decisions to make and experiences to go through during the remainder of my life.
