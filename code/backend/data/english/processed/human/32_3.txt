What appeals to me about the Graphic Design course offered at Pratt, is the huge range of flexibility to suit my interests. It would help me to pursue my career aspirations in this field, and emerge as an artist, and perhaps follow the lead given by great creative masters, allowing me the freedom to choose my courses in such a way that they are largely useful to my achievement in my selected field of graphic design.
