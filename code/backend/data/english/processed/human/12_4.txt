More complex metaphors show an even greater divergence from similes, as they do not even have to explicitly state both of the things being compared. Take the following as an example: "As the sun set, night slowly spread its black wings against the clouded sky." At first glance, it is possible to miss the fact that there is a comparison here at all. Looking through the elements of the sentence in order, we come first to the sun, but find nothing to which it is compared. Next we see night, then black wings, and a clouded sky. The clouded sky is merely the background against which the wings are spread, and so is not an object for comparison either. This leaves us with night and black wings. These are not being compared here, but we can see that these wings belong somehow to the night. Again, since this is a literal impossibility, we know we are in the presence of figurative language. So, night is said to possess some feature that is could not possibly possess, black wings. Now, this makes us think what creature might have black wings that would be the origin of the comparison. There are many options here, but a bat, that infamous creature of the dark, seems like the most likely candidate. So, in this subtle metaphor, night is being compared to a bat even though bats are never explicitly mentioned. Even more than the simplest sort of metaphor, this more subtle kind forces us to think more deeply about the situation at hand, and as a result we generate more vivid and unexpected ideas and images, which is the purpose of metaphor.
