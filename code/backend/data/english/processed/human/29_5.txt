Black Theology's themes of hope and liberation had opened up the eyes of black and white people. It had focused the need of Christians to reach out to God's suffering children. There are various passages in the New Testament which have an ideology of equality in Christ's eyes (Galatians 3:27) and the main purpose of Jesus dying for our salvation regardless of race. These kind of passages help emphasise the Gospel's values of peace and equality (the main ideology in Martin Luther King's Civil Rights Movement). In the eyes of our God, we are all his people (black, white, Indian, Latino, oriental etc.) As Christians, we must be aware that the black people were suffering and through Black Theology, it has provided not only the liberation for black people, but freed white people from racial discrimination and non - Christian conduct.
