Like simile, metaphor is a comparison of two things which are in general dissimilar. In the case of metaphor, however, the comparison is indirect rather than direct; it is implied rather than stated outright. For example, when I use the simile "the boy fought like a tiger," it is evident that I am comparing the two things, that I am aware of the comparison, and that I am comparing specific characteristics in an exaggerated way. However, when this simile is turned into the simplest kind of metaphor, we see that the directness and specificity of the comparison are lost: "The boy was a tiger when he fought." The first difference is the absence of like or as, keys words in the formation of similes which make the comparison direct. In this case, the comparison is implicit. We have not stated that the boy can be compared to a tiger, but rather that the boy is a tiger. This immediately alerts us to the presence of figurative language, because the statement, taken literally, simply cannot be true. Two dissimilar things may be comparable in some way, as the simile shows, but two dissimilar things cannot be each other, and so the metaphor cannot work on the level of the literal.
