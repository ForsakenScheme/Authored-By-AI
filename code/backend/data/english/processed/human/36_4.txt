The characterization by Golding supports his argument that humans are profoundly diabolical. He writes, "Kill the pig. Cut her throat. Bash her in..." (75), the group's chant when they all together have killed their first pig. This indirectly portrays the savagery that has slowly developed in the group, in an environment where there are no rules to live by, but had been attempted to be established. Golding later writes "He could see a striped savage moving hastily out of the green tangle, and coming toward the mat where he hid, a savage who carried a spear..." (198) as Ralph, the last hope of civilization and order for the group is hunted down by Jack's boys. In this sequence, Golding directly characterizes a group of school boys who had turned into a group of uncivilized human beings with diction. This in turn also gives confirmation to the change in human nature of the boys ever since their arrival after the plane crash. The setting of a society with rules are no longer in place, had greatly changed the behavior of the boys. Lord of the Flies reflects on Golding's belief that people of all age groups have innate capacity for evil and that this natural capacity is never too far from a civilized society.
