In other instances, Hamlet's madness can be seen as feigned. An example is Hamlet's interaction with Polonius. Hamlet states, "Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here/ that old men have gray beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes purging thick amber and/ plum-tree gum" (2.2, 197-200). Hamlet uses his feigned madness to his advantage to insult Polonius indirectly by cleverly crafting the subject of his book towards the explicit description of Polonius. Clearly, Hamlet's wit shows that he has not lost his reason and is not mad. Another example of Hamlet's feigned madness is Hamlet's communication with the ghost of his father while Gertrude is present. Gertrude, who cannot see the ghost, tells Hamlet, "No, nothing but ourselves...this the very coinage of your brain./ This bodiless creation ecstasy/ Is very cunning in..." (3.4, 134-139). Gertrude thinks Hamlet is mad, because she sees him talking to nothing. She thinks he is talking to himself. The audience knows that Hamlet is not in fact mad, since the audience sees in the play that he is actually talking to the ghost of his father.
