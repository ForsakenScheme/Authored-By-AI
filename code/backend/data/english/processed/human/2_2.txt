But I digress. The point is, we've all seen those ads online that tell us we can earn a Master's in under thirty seconds from the University of Yeah, Right. Actually, most of these are legit. A multitude of respectable colleges and universities are offering actual online degree programs, or at the very least, online classes. And it seems like a dream. Suddenly we can go to class in our pajamas - or, gasp!, nothing at all - and no one will care. We can go to class at four o'clock in the morning. Why isn't everyone doing this, we think?
