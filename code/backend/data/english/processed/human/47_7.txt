Mr. Underwood is also featured as a man with both physical and moral courage. He was prepared with his shotgun to protect Atticus in the confrontation in front of the jail house, even though he did not have anything to do with the case. While he appeared as a good friend, always ready to protect his friend before the trial, after the death of Tom Robinson, his personality was shown clearly to everyone. He condemned Tom Robinson's death on The Maycomb Tribune, paying no attention to the fact that he might lose all his advertisement clients. He pointed out that killing Tom was senseless slaughter. It was made clear in his editorial that no matter how hard Atticus tried to defend Tom Robinson, he would never be able to bring justice to his clients, for it simply was a case between a white and a black, in which the black had no way to escape from the accusation. Showing all his opinions to the public might upset his subscribers and reduce his income, but Mr. Underwood could not have cared less. He was deeply frustrated about the unfair and tragic, yet expected end of the case; and he dared to bring his views to the public. In this case, with his genuine words, Mr. Underwood was a courageous gentleman in Maycomb society.
