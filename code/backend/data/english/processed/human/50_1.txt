Humanity collectively owns a nebulous capability for evil and flexes this inherent muscle with epicurean apathy. "The belief in a supernatural source of evil is not necessary; men alone are quite capable of every wickedness." so said famous author Joseph Conrad who delved deep into the human psyche and discovered there a "heart of darkness". It is precisely this sentiment that Dostoyevsky echoes in his novel, Crime and Punishment. Illuminated through cerebral use of philosophies on the human psychology and the exploits of Rodya Raskolnikov, a murderous young man suffering from mental turmoil, the reader is presented with a concise theory as to the level and depth of immorality humanity truly possesses.
