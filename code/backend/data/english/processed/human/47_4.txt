Mrs. Dubose herself was a woman of strong will and moral courage. Morphine had been her pain-killer. She could choose to take a less painful death, but she was determined to "leave this world beholden to nothing and nobody". She meant to break her morphine addiction before passing away, and she succeeded over herself. She died beholden to nothing and nobody. Mrs. Dubose showed us what real courage is, not a man with a gun in his hand, but an ill woman overcoming all her weaknesses, she was the bravest person in Atticus's point of view.
