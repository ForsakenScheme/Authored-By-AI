And it is this idea of religion playing no part in one's base nature, fuels the nihilist argument that an individual is uniquely responsible for his or her own sufferings founded upon his/her psychological state which is in turn affected by the componential darkness present in all human minds. Rodya acknowledges this when he replies to Sonya, "It was not because of your dishonor and your sin I said that of you, but because of your great suffering. But you are a great sinner, that's true."(353). Here, Rodya acts as the voice of the author, illuminating a premise that uses the assertion that man's basic nature is one of darkness by qualifying Sonya's "purity". In this scene Dostoyevsky seeks to expound the idea that although Sonya may or may not be "sacrificing" herself for the good of her siblings, it does not matter for she still toils in sin and evil as an occupation by her own free will. The author chooses the picturesquely innocent Sonya, to show that even the most righteous and noble being not only holds the capacity for great sin, but exercises it- this is literary verification that even people considered saintly have in common with the most vile criminal, a depth of evil that is applicable to all.
