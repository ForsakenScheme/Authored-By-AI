The role reversal that Oedipus goes through is centered on sight, and the lack thereof. Throughout the play, Oedipus is searching for the truth about his past. Though the truth may be obvious to the audience at some points, Oedipus is blind to the truth that is right in front of him. "I say that you, with both your eyes, are blind: / You can not see the wretchedness of your life," Teiresias says on page 22 to Oedipus when Oedipus refuses to believe him. Teiresias is a blind man who sees the truth, while Oedipus is a sighted man who is blind to the truth. The more he mocks Teiresias, ("...you sightless, witless, senseless, mad old man!" (20) ) the more ironic Oedipus sounds to the audience because by the end of the play, Oedipus will switch roles and lose his sense of sight when he becomes aware of the truth. Teiresias even knows that Oedipus will be blinded by the end of the play, "...with only night / Upon your precious eyes." (23).
