A lot of organisations nowadays use mergers and acquisitions as a major strategy for business growth and continuity.The key principle behind a merger or acquisition is to create shareholder value over and above that of the sum of the two companies (Investopedia, 2008). It is assumed that two companies together are more valuable than two separate companies. Companies usually consider this option during periods of difficulty and target companies will often agree to be purchased when they know they cannot survive alone. Strong companies seek to buy other companies to create a more competitive, cost-efficient company. The companies will come together hoping to gain a greater market share or to achieve greater efficiency.
