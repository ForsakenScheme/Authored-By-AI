A main argument comes from one of the main components in the cause of Black Theology, James Cone. Cone perceived theology as a study of God in an oppressed community that relates Jesus Christ to liberation. Cone's view is an expansion of theology's meaning, deriving from Greek. (theo meaning God and logo meaning the study of.) This concept of Black Theology is inclusive of Cone's concept of theology. In spite of the racial connotations which are only inclusive of black people, Cone further develops this idea. Black is not only meant in the physical sense, it is also defined as either having an attitude or acting in support of black liberation. For Cone, liberation from white oppression was the only relevant hope for equality in society.
