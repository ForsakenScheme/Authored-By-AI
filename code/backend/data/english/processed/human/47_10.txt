Boo Radley's action to protect the children at the end of the book was an extraordinary heroic act. With his moral courage, he overcome his difficulties and worries to step out of his comfort zone to rescue the kids from danger. By attacking Bob Ewell, Boo Radley put an end to the series of evil deeds done by this deceitful man. In a way, this act of moral courage did bring justice back to its place, where by a person has to pay a high price for his mistakes. Even though it is rough justice in this case, when the truth is told not in the court but in the dark, creepy park in the middle of the night, and the children had to suffer emotional trauma after being attacked, justice is still done. Hence, in my opinion, Boo Radley's moral courage puts everything in its place, driving the evils away, bringing back peace and justice to Maycomb people.
