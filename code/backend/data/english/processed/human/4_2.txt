The first step for an average student to begin a dissertation is deciding to commit to the time and work needed to complete the project. Go talk to other graduate students who have completed their dissertation. Talk to different professors about the dissertation that you have in mind. What do they think of your ideas? Be willing to listen and take advice from experienced graduate students and/or professors.
