The author makes use of ethos, pathos, and logos. The author makes the powerful use of pathos to people's values and beliefs. He talks of nature's natural beauty and how it should be preserved. And if people are naturally good, that they'll realize what they're looking over and destroying. The use of pathos is also used to make people who benefit from the damn feel guilty, by describing that the water was polluted after the damn was built. He uses his work as a park ranger to appeal to the ethos. To show that he has a firsthand account of the events. I feel that the law there lacks the use of logos to appeal to the readers reason. The evidence he presents his from a personal point of view and not from facts and he seems to lack of consistency.
