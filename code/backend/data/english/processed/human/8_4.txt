At this point, most of my goals are subject to change on a daily basis (other than desire to enter college, of course). My subconscious is also maintaining some vague images of great discoveries and breakthroughs (my dad continues to pressure me into developing a cure for cancer). Aside from the intrinsic aspirations of overwhelming success, eternal happiness, etc., one of my primary objectives is simply to enjoy life. This basic revelation was influenced by one of the last speeches of our school play, You Can't Take it With You (my latest acting adventure): "You've got all the money you need. You can't take it with you. ... Where does the fun come in? Don't you think there ought to be something more, Mr. Kirby? You must have wanted more than that when you started out. We haven't got too much time, you know - any of us." After all (yeah, I really like quotes), "There is only one success - to be able to spend your life in your own way."
