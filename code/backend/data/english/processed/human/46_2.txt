A merger is said to occur when two firms, often of about the same size, agree to go forward as a single new company rather than remain separately owned and operated (Investopedia, 2008). Investopedia (2008)) also defines an acquisition as a process in which one company takes over another and clearly established itself as the new owner. From a legal point of view, the target company ceases to exist, the buyer "swallows" the business and the buyer's stock continues to be traded. Whether the process is called a merger or an acquisition ultimately depends on whether the purchase is friendly or hostile and how it is announced. In other words, the real difference lies in how the purchase is communicated to and received by the target company's board of directors, employees and shareholders.
