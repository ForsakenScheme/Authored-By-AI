At some point, you may have heard about the Darfur Crisis. It is a continuously unfolding tragedy sweeping the Darfur region of Sudan, a country in Northern Africa. Though much of the world has called for "action" since hearing of this ongoing butchery, little has been done, with some saying that it is not our problem, and others continuously squabbling over what label to place on the situation (avoiding the word "genocide"), as well as what action to take, if any.
