It is evident that in the calming of the storm, Matthew and Luke copy the format of Mark's Gospel. Although, both Mathew and Luke each present their stories in different ways. In Mark's Gospel, he gives a full and detailed account of the story. On the other hand, Luke takes are more direct approach. He tell the story in only three verses accounting for only the main points found in Mark's Gospel. In contrast, Matthew accounts the story in a more poetic style. It is more elaborate than Luke's and is perhaps the most enjoyable to read.
