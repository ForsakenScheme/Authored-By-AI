A CTO and an IT architect (could be a staff or consultant) should have a seat at the due diligence table from the onset of the merger or acquisition process. (Guest, 2006) has indicated that an IT architect involved in this process must possess five core skills to function effectively. These are an appreciation of the IT environment where is working, an understanding of the business/technology strategy, design skills necessary for creating solutions, quality attributes that cut across every technology solution and human dynamics. These skills will be especially useful in a merger or acquisition by enabling him provide a detailed map of the IT infrastructure and capabilities of the organisations involved in the proposed merger or acquisition which can then be presented to the business executives involved in the process (Boomer, 2006).
