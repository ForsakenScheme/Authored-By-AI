The "perfect" drugs that can be developed in the future will not do mankind any good. Sure a "soma" may keep people happy, but it will also turn humans into machines, without feelings to guide them. Feelings are the driving force behind humans. Why had many scientific advances been made in the past? Why had many new lands been discovered? Emotions- love for science, love for other humans, hate for crime, hate for disease and even greed guide people. The Savage was one of the very few lucky people left who still knew what it was like to feel hatred, what it was like to feel love, what it was like to feel sorrow and he realized that he did not want to be alone in a world where people did not experience emotions and where soma could cure all of your problems. He did not want that life and his emotions made him act upon his feelings.
