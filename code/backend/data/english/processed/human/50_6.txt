And the notion that humanity is born with an evil side must give way to corresponding psychological conjectures and principles. One of Dostoyevsky's prime examples of what an inner darkness' constraints consist of can be seen in Rodya's "monomania". In reference to the madness one may feel coping with a fundamental evil, the author writes, "In that sense we are certainly all not infrequently like madmen, but with the slight difference that the deranged are somewhat madder, for we must draw a line. A normal man, it is true, hardly exists.(340). It is acknowledged immediately in the novel that a "madman" such as Rodya who possesses "monomania" or any psychosis is a detriment to themselves and potentially to their society. With this in mind, the quote explores the depth and level to which inborn evil puppets an individual, remarking that indeed "we are all...like mad men", but the underlying question is answered when he responds with, "...we must draw a line...". It is when this "line" is drawn that certain characters fall under the mentally "deranged" title and a new philosophy about their responsibility in their illness must be contemplated. Much like modern day legalities and medicines, humanity faces the widely accepted truth that there exists people who are not in control of their faculties and commit evil crimes- we call them "mentally ill", and special rules, responsibilities, and punishments are applied to them. By Dostoyevsky's standard and the above quote, every man possesses the same "madness" or monomania that a murderer such as Rodya does. And it is this joint ownership of the same madness or in other words, evil that unties all of the human race.
