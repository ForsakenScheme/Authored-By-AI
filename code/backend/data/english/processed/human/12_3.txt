Because it need not be so direct as a simile, a metaphor can be conveyed in a far wider variety of forms, ranging from the very simple to the very complex. The shortest and easiest form of the metaphor is the kind mentioned above, where one thing is called another. This achieves the basic function of metaphor, which is to invite us to explore the possible relationships between the two entities which are said to be the same. It allows for vivid description, and even more than simile asks us to consider the two entities together, holding each in our imaginations as we read. Because it is less direct, the metaphor also forces us to think more closely about the basis of comparison between the things under comparison, and this causes us to be more involved in the reading.
