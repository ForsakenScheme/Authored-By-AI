The most fascinating character in the novel, Boo Radley surprised us at the end of the novel with his bravery. Bob Ewell, mean and evil as ever, planned to attack the Finch children in the middle of the night. When Bob Ewell got Jem, and was about to harm Scout, out of the blue, Boo Radley appeared and stabbed Bob Ewell with a kitchen knife, stopping him from getting the children. This action appears to be physical courage, as Boo used his strength to defeat Bob Ewell; however deep beneath the surface of the matter, it was Boo's determination that was exceptional. Being locked up in his house for years, nothing could take him out of his house. He had always been attracted to the Finch children, he even gave them little presents in the oak tree, aside from the time he wrapped a blanket around Scout's shoulder when Miss Maudie's house was on fire, he had never gone out of his house; the reasons being probably he was a timid person, detached from the society for so long that he did not want to come out. The second reason was his frail health- he was very sick; even after he defeated Ewell, Scout realised that he was coughing very badly. However, this time, Boo was so concerned about the children's safety that he risked himself getting out of the house, making a public appearance to rescue them. Is it not true that his moral courage outshines his physical ability?
