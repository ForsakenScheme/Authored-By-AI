Design has not been thoroughly institutionalized. Design may be claimed as art, or, as Ettore Sottsass (Italy, b. 1917), a designer of great influence, has said: 'To me design...is a way of discussing life. It is a way of discussing society, politics, eroticism, food and even design. At the end, it is a way of building up a possible figurative utopia or metaphor about life.' I have always had a penchant for art and certainly want to work conscientiously to further develop my skills in the subject. I want to pursue undergraduate study in visual arts, majoring in the Graphic Design course, particularly in the Pratt Institute, School of Design, in New York City.
