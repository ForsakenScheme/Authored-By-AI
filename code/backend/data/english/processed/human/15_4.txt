The enabler of such questioning is cognitive development use of logical reasoning to understand the world around them in determining where they fit into it. This is a characteristic of adolescence due to cognitive development and increase brain functioning. The use of logical reasoning is also exemplified in the enlightenment through writings and academic endeavor. It is in adolescence where people are first able to "think outside the box" and think hypothetically. Adolescents use what they know or have observed to make a deductive conclusion. This happens in academic situations in the classroom, but also within their own social lives. Say they have a dispute with a close friend, it is during adolescence where for the first time they are able look at the situation as an outside observer, objectively (it does not mean they will). This way of thinking is almost a direct reflection of the scientific method, which defined the way scholars during the enlightenment, approached the study of humanity. As a result of thinking and reasoning logically to determine where they fit amongst what they observe around them, adolescents begins the process of identity formation.
