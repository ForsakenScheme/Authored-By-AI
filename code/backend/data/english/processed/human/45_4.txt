Road to Perdition takes place during the early 1930s, a time in American history that I find fascinating. Now I know this is more of a personal thing to enjoy the scenes of the 1930s. This is something unique I believe, even to me. My interests are usually Medieval Europe or Feudal Japan, also mixed together with magic and fantasy. - This part does not belong here; it takes you off track.
