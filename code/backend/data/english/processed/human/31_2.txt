It is, however, not simply the content of these works that I treasure, but the connections they share with my past. Only 10 years ago, I was a third-grader in Nara, Japan. But at the end of that school year, my family and I left Japan and we have never returned. Since then, my greatest fear has been the fragility of my own memory. Will there come a day when I realize I can no longer remember the name of my home town? Reading manga and watching anim√Ø is the only thing that has allowed me to continue to speak Japanese fluently. My younger brother, who was unable to hold onto such ties, has hence forgotten even the simplest of Japanese words.
