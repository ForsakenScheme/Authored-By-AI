One of the most difficult reasons for students not creating a dissertation is the fact that this is an experience they have never done before. It is like riding a bicycle the first time or the first time behind the wheel of an automobile. Most people who go to graduate school have already written several research topics. They, also, have given many demonstrations and/or speeches. Most students who go to graduate school are good students. What puts the fear into most students is the fact that they have never written a dissertation. Any graduate student with a lot of hard work can create a successful dissertation or thesis.
