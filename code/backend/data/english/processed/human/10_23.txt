Conglomerate corporations will primarily provide internet news, this is because they have the capital and means to research and develop the products quickly and efficiently. The technologies that are beginning to emerge surpass the wildest imaginations of most people. A technology known as Artificial Journalism that has been deployed as a prototype and proven to work on a small scale basis is a system that creates fully personalized news articles based on the aforementioned personalization systems. The technology utilizes artificial intelligence and huge profile databases to develop articles written entirely by computers. What this system does is accumulate news articles from sources all over the world and catalogues them in a database. Upon a user’s query, the system would gather all appropriate articles, filter them based on user relevancy and popularity throughout the world, and seamlessly combine them, fixing any grammatical and structural error before delivering it to the consumer. All of this can be achieved with little or no human interaction, with exclusions on the user’s behalf.
