My high school art teacher once said that art is a form of problem-solving. But unlike math, he said, in art there is never a single correct solution. He pointed his pencil toward the class and said that each one of us had a chance to create solutions. My interest in art and design has continued to grow since I was quite young. To me design is a language, just like music. Design is the planning and organizing of elements of art in such a way which is best to accomplish a certain purpose, following the principals of design. Other than just being an art which is commercially 'useful', design is a means of visually portraying a particular message. The message is a composition Ã¯ a unified and thoughtful piece of work that will interest the viewer. The composition must have a main objective; for example, on one hand it could convey either harmony or balance, or on the other hand it could portray contrast or even create disturbance in the mind of the spectator. However, the goal of the design is to be the best solution. Thus the intention of a designer is to be the best problem-solver.
