In terms of cheating, I think there are a lot of different causes. From the student's perspective, I suspect that pressure is one of the primary reasons that students cheat. College and university students are under tremendous pressure to accomplish certain goals in their studies, but high grades are certainly at the top. Thus, they are pressured from their parents, their professors and of course themselves.
