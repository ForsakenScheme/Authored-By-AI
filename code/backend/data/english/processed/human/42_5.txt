Therefore, Hamlet's madness is questionable through Hamlet's real madness, feigned actions, and the reactions of others. By providing few stage directions, Shakespeare leaves the audience to make its own interpretation. The audience is left with Hamlet's words and actions and the reactions of others to determine if Hamlet's madness is in fact feigned or real. Regardless, these parts of evidence are insufficient in clearly defining Shakespeare's complex character Hamlet. Furthermore, to better understand the reactions of the characters in the play, the modern audience must familiarize itself with the Renaissance way of thinking, since the play was written during that time period for that audience. Nevertheless, the complication of the character and the modern audience's way of thinking altogether hinders to know truly if Hamlet is mad. As a result, Hamlet's madness can be best understood only through one's own interpretation.
