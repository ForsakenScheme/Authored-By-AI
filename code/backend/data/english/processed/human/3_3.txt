Different students have different ways of taking notes. No one way is correct. However, an important point is to review the notes as soon as possible after class. Rewrite these notes. Often students scribble main points down and they may forget what these scribbles were later on. Rewriting notes helps the student to put the main points in long-term memory. Rewriting the notes also prevents the student from not being able to read his or her own notes later.
