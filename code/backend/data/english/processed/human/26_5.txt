Member states such as Brazil, India, Japan and Germany want a permanent seat in the Council, as its state geopolitical weight is more significant than the medium rank powers that hold vetoes in Council (Morris 2005:8). These states argue that it wants to increase its region representation to assure that matters on their part of the world are taken into consideration (Daley, Lionel 2006:35). Furthermore, many members recognize that the current UN structure gives too much power to rich nations, ignoring middle power and developing states and those who were not seen as powerful prior to the WWII (Mikhailitchenkom 2004:4). Disagreement on whether these states should be permanent or have veto power has become an obstacle to Council reform (Global Policy Forum 2005). Nevertheless, members oppose the creation of new permanent seats insisting that the Council should only be enlarged with new elected members. While others claim, that the enlargement would make the Council unwieldy and ineffective (Morris 2005:8). Nevertheless, despite having ten other elected members, the Security Council remains geographically unbalanced and seriously unrepresentative. The overall consensus in that the Security Council needs to be enlarged for it to be more representatives (Mikhailitchenkom 2004:5).
