Many students dread taking notes.. It is important for students to know how to take notes because often professors create tests over what they have lectured on. It is important to prepare for note taking, take good notes, and study these notes for tests. Taking notes actually benefits the student because it forces a student to listen and to try to understand what is being stated. It also gives the student something to review before tests. Personal notes are usually easier to study and reflect upon than another student's notes. The practice of writing something down stays in the memory longer.
