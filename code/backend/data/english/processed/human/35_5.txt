Depending on the intended crowd, graphic designers must plan and analyze in order to reach out successfully with their visual solutions. I believe that studying at Savannah would automatically provide me this platform. It would infuse the knowledge needed to cope with ever-changing social and environmental factors, and creative departments which are starving for competing designers who are capable of upholding brand identities. Savannah would direct me to the canvas, where the empty space will represent my identity. And any marks I make on the canvas would be a part of me, as taught by Savannah in order to survive in this field as an artistic style which works with the audience. That would be my means of expressing the views of "the people" to the people themselves ï the viewers and the listeners ï the target.
