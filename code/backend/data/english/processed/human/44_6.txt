Another theme that shows that sight is a symbol for knowledge is the oracles and their predictions. The oracles see the future and are aware of the truth; they know more than Oedipus and the other regular characters. The oracles' sight is questioned many times, and is an ongoing theme during the entire play. For example Iocaste says the oracles are wrong, and then is immediately seen praying to the Gods. "From now on, where oracles are concerned, / I would not waste a second thought on any...To you, then, Apollo, / Lycean lord, since you are nearest, I turn in prayer," (46-48).
