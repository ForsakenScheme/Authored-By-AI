One of the most significant advantages of online study is its flexibility. Unlike traditional classroom settings, where students are required to attend lectures at specific times and locations, online courses allow students to study at their own pace and on their own schedule. This flexibility is especially beneficial for students who have other commitments, such as work or family responsibilities, as it allows them to balance their studies with their other obligations.
