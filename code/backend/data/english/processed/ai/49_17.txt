Moreover, researchers examine the impact of births outside of marriage on children's well-being, exploring issues such as parental involvement, economic stability, and access to social support services. Studies also investigate the socio-cultural attitudes towards non-marital childbearing, including stigma, discrimination, and the role of media in shaping public perceptions of unmarried parents and their families. Additionally, sociologists analyze the intersectionality of race, class, and gender within non-marital childbearing, recognizing the ways in which structural inequalities shape individuals' experiences and opportunities.
