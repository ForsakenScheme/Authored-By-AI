Additionally, the novel raises thought-provoking questions about the fragility of civilization and the thin veneer of morality that separates humanity from savagery. Golding suggests that under the right circumstances, even the most civilized individuals are capable of committing unspeakable acts of violence and brutalityâ€”a sobering reminder of the darkness that lurks within us all.
