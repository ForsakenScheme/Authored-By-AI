Another helpful strategy is to use a structured note-taking format, such as the Cornell method or the outline method. These formats provide a framework for organizing your notes into categories, headings, and subheadings, making it easier to identify the main ideas and relationships between them. Experiment with different note-taking formats to find the one that works best for you and your learning style.
