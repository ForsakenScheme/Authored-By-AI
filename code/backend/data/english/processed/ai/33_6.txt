Moreover, society plays a pivotal role in shaping our perceptions of originality, conformity, and creativity, as it provides the cultural context and framework within which we navigate our identities and aspirations. In a society that values conformity and uniformity, individuals may feel pressured to conform to societal norms and expectations, sacrificing their authenticity and creative potential in the process. Conversely, in a society that celebrates diversity and individuality, individuals may feel empowered to embrace their uniqueness and pursue their creative passions with confidence and purpose.
