Furthermore, porcelain's interaction with form and space invites artists to explore sculptural possibilities and push the boundaries of artistic expression. Whether through intricate carving, delicate molding, or innovative construction techniques, artists can manipulate porcelain to create forms that defy gravity and challenge the viewer's perception of space. From delicate figurines to monumental installations, porcelain art occupies a dynamic space that blurs the line between art and sculpture, inviting viewers to engage with its physical presence and spatial dynamics.
