Moreover, Dostoevsky introduces a cast of characters who embody different aspects of human nature, ranging from altruism to depravity. Sonya Marmeladov, a young prostitute, exemplifies selflessness and compassion, offering Raskolnikov spiritual solace and redemption. In contrast, characters like Svidrigailov and Luzhin embody selfishness, manipulation, and moral bankruptcy, highlighting the darker impulses of human nature. Through these characters, Dostoevsky explores the capacity for both good and evil within the human soul, suggesting that individuals possess the freedom to choose their actions but are also subject to the influences of their environment and circumstances.
