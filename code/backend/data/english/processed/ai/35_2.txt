Art, at its essence, is an exploration of possibilities. It invites me to step outside the confines of conventional thinking, just as tackling a complex problem requires breaking free from the rigidity of standard solutions. Whether I'm wielding a paintbrush or delving into a mathematical equation, the act of creation encourages me to envision alternatives, experiment with diverse perspectives, and embrace the ambiguity inherent in problem-solving.
