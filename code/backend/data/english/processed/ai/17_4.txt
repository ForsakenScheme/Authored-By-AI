Furthermore, cheating can become normalized within certain academic cultures or peer groups, leading students to view it as an acceptable or even expected behavior. In environments where cheating is widespread or tacitly condoned, students may feel pressure to conform to these norms in order to fit in or maintain their social standing. The desire for peer approval and acceptance can outweigh the ethical considerations of cheating, leading students to prioritize short-term gains over long-term integrity.
