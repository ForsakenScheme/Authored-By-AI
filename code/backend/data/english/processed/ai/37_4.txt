Some studies suggest that violence is socially learned, meaning individuals observe and mimic violent behaviors modeled by family members or within their social environment. This perspective emphasizes the role of upbringing and socialization in shaping violent tendencies across generations. On the other hand, there's a growing body of research indicating genetic and neurobiological factors may also contribute to the perpetuation of violence across generations. This biological perspective underscores the interplay between genetics, brain chemistry, and environmental influences in predisposing individuals to violent behavior.
