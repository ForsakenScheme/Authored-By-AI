In Fyodor Dostoevsky's seminal work, "Crime and Punishment," the question of whether mankind is inherently good or evil lies at the heart of the narrative. Through the protagonist, Rodion Raskolnikov, Dostoevsky grapples with the complexities of human nature, morality, and the consequences of individual actions. While the novel does not offer a definitive answer to this existential question, it explores the interplay between morality, rationality, and conscience in shaping human behavior.
