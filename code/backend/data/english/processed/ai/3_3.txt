Additionally, good note-taking facilitates organization and structure in our learning. By condensing and summarizing information into concise notes, we create a reference tool that we can revisit later to review and reinforce our understanding. Well-organized notes also make it easier to study for exams, write essays, and complete assignments, as they provide a clear roadmap of the material covered.
