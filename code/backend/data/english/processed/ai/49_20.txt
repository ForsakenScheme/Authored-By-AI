Moreover, scholars investigate variations in marriage patterns across demographic groups, such as age, race, ethnicity, and socio-economic status, highlighting disparities in marital outcomes and experiences. Studies also analyze the impact of legal and policy changes, such as marriage equality legislation and no-fault divorce laws, on marriage rates and dynamics. Additionally, sociologists explore the intersections of marriage with other social institutions, such as religion, education, and employment, to understand how these factors shape individuals' decisions about marriage and partnership.
