At the outset of the novel, Raskolnikov, a destitute former student, rationalizes his plan to commit a heinous crime: the murder of a pawnbroker. He believes himself to be a "superman" who transcends conventional morality and is justified in committing the crime for the greater good of society. However, as the novel unfolds, Raskolnikov is consumed by guilt and tormented by his conscience, ultimately confessing to his crime and seeking redemption through suffering and penance. Dostoevsky's portrayal of Raskolnikov's inner turmoil reflects the existential struggle between the forces of good and evil within the human psyche.
