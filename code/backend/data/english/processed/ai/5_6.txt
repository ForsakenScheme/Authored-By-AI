As a student navigating the complexities of ELA instruction, I have found that one of the most rewarding aspects is the opportunity to explore diverse perspectives and voices through literature. Whether reading classic works of literature or contemporary texts, ELA instruction exposes students to a wide range of ideas, cultures, and experiences, fostering empathy, tolerance, and understanding. Through literature, students are able to connect with characters and stories that resonate with their own lives, as well as those that challenge their assumptions and broaden their horizons.
