Additionally, the courage of characters like Miss Maudie Atkinson and Heck Tate, who quietly resist the entrenched racism of Maycomb through their words and actions, serves as a counterpoint to the more overt forms of bravery exhibited by Atticus and Boo. Miss Maudie's resilience in the face of adversity and Heck Tate's commitment to truth and justice highlight the myriad ways in which courage can manifest in everyday acts of defiance and resistance.
