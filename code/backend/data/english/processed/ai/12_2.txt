First and foremost, metaphors are ubiquitous in our language, providing a rich tapestry of imagery and symbolism that enhances communication and expression. We use metaphors instinctively to convey abstract concepts and emotions in concrete terms, making them more relatable and understandable to others. For example, phrases like "time is money" and "love is a journey" encapsulate complex ideas in simple, familiar terms, allowing us to convey meaning with greater clarity and impact.
