In addition to their linguistic and cognitive functions, metaphors also play a crucial role in shaping our cultural identity and social interactions. Shared metaphors and idioms serve as markers of group membership and cultural belonging, creating a sense of solidarity and cohesion within communities. For example, sports metaphors like "hitting it out of the park" or "scoring a goal" are commonly used in business and politics to convey success and achievement, drawing on the universal appeal of athletic competition to inspire and motivate.
