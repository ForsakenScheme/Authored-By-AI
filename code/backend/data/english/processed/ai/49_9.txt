Furthermore, the study of family violence extends beyond the immediate family unit to encompass broader societal implications and responses. Researchers investigate the role of institutions, such as law enforcement, child welfare agencies, and healthcare systems, in identifying and responding to cases of family violence, examining issues of accountability, access to resources, and systemic barriers to intervention. By examining the complex dynamics of family violence and its impact on individuals and communities, sociologists contribute to a deeper understanding of the social and structural factors that perpetuate violence within familial relationships and advocate for policies and practices that promote safety, healing, and justice.
