So, what are some strategies for taking good notes? One important tip is to be selective about what you write down. It's not feasible or necessary to record every single word spoken or written during a lecture or reading session. Instead, focus on capturing key ideas, main points, definitions, and examples that are essential for understanding the material. Be sure to use your own words and abbreviations to make your notes concise and easy to review later.
