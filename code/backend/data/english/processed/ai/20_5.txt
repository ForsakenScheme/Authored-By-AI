Furthermore, children possess a remarkable resilience and capacity for growth, even in the face of unimaginable loss. As they learn to navigate the complexities of grief, children can develop valuable coping skills and strategies for managing their emotions, such as journaling, art therapy, or engaging in meaningful activities that honor the memory of their loved one. Through these activities, children can find a sense of empowerment and agency in their grief, reclaiming a sense of control over their emotions and their lives.
