One of the primary reasons why students cheat is the intense pressure to excel academically and maintain high grades. In today's hypercompetitive educational environment, there is often an overwhelming emphasis on grades as a measure of success and worth. As a result, students may feel compelled to resort to cheating in order to meet unrealistic expectations or avoid the consequences of failure. The fear of disappointing parents, teachers, or peers can also contribute to the temptation to cheat, as students may feel pressured to maintain a fa√ßade of success at all costs.
