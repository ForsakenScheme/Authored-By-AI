One of the most enchanting aspects of porcelain is its interaction with light. Due to its translucent nature, porcelain has the remarkable ability to transmit and reflect light in subtle and nuanced ways. When illuminated from behind, porcelain pieces glow with an ethereal radiance, casting intricate patterns of light and shadow that dance across their surfaces. This interplay of light adds depth, dimension, and visual interest to porcelain art, captivating the viewer and drawing them into its luminous embrace.
