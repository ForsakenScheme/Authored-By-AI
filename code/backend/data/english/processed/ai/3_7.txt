Finally, don't be afraid to personalize your note-taking process to suit your individual needs and preferences. Some students prefer handwritten notes, while others prefer typing on a laptop or tablet. Some students like to use color coding or highlighting to emphasize important points, while others prefer to keep their notes simple and straightforward. Find what works best for you and stick with it.
