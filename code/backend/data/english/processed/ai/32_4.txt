Graphics, on the other hand, serve as a visual language through which designers communicate ideas, information, and emotions to audiences. Whether it's through typography, imagery, color, or layout, graphics have the power to evoke mood, convey meaning, and elicit response in viewers. From logos and advertisements to posters and websites, graphics play a pivotal role in shaping our perceptions and influencing our behaviors in the world around us.
