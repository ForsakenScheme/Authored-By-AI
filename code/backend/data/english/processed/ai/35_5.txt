Art has taught me the value of divergent thinking â€” the ability to generate a multitude of solutions to a single problem. This skill, honed in the studio, proves invaluable when tackling multifaceted problems in subjects like literature or history. By cultivating a diverse range of perspectives, I enhance my capacity to analyze complex issues and devise nuanced solutions.
