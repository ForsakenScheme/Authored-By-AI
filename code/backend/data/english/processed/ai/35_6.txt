The act of creation in art is inherently a process of problem-solving. Whether I'm sculpting with clay or crafting prose, I encounter unexpected challenges that demand on-the-spot solutions. This adaptability, cultivated in the realm of art, serves me well when confronted with unforeseen twists in academic pursuits. Problem-solving becomes an exercise in creative resourcefulness, drawing on a repertoire of skills honed through artistic endeavors.
