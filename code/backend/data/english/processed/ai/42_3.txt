However, the nature of Hamlet's madness remains ambiguous throughout the play, blurring the lines between genuine insanity and calculated pretense. While some characters, such as Polonius and Gertrude, interpret Hamlet's behavior as a sign of madness, others, like Horatio, remain skeptical, recognizing the method in his madness. Hamlet himself acknowledges the artifice of his madness, declaring to Horatio, "I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly, I know a hawk from a handsaw."
