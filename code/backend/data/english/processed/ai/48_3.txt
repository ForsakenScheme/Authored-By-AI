One of the most notable instances of loyalty in Beowulf is seen in the character of Wiglaf, Beowulf's loyal retainer. When Beowulf faces his final battle against the dragon, it is Wiglaf who stands by his side, risking his own life to honor his oath of fealty and uphold the legacy of his king. Wiglaf's unwavering loyalty to Beowulf serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of steadfastness and fidelity in the face of adversity.
