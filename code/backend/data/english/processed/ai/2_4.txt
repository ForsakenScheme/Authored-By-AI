However, despite its many benefits, online study also has its drawbacks. One of the main challenges of online learning is the lack of face-to-face interaction with instructors and peers. While virtual classrooms and discussion forums can facilitate communication and collaboration, they may not fully replicate the interpersonal dynamics and social connections that occur in traditional classroom settings. This lack of social interaction can sometimes lead to feelings of isolation and disengagement among online students.
