Political revolutions, such as the American Revolution in the 18th century and the French Revolution in the late 18th century, exemplify the pursuit of political autonomy and the overthrow of monarchical rule. These revolutions were fueled by Enlightenment ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity, and they fundamentally altered the political landscape, giving rise to democratic principles and the notion of self-governance.
