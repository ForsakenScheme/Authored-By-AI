"Road to Perdition," directed by Sam Mendes and released in 2002, stands as a cinematic masterpiece that weaves a tale of crime, redemption, and the complexities of father-son relationships against the backdrop of 1930s America. Adapted from the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins, the film transports viewers into a world of organized crime and moral ambiguity, where the boundaries between good and evil are blurred and redemption comes at a steep price.
