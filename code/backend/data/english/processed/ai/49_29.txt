Moreover, scholars investigate the impact of disciplinary practices on children's development, exploring issues such as psychological well-being, self-esteem, and moral reasoning. Research in this area also examines variations in disciplinary approaches across demographic groups, including differences based on socio-economic status, race, ethnicity, and parenting styles. Additionally, sociologists analyze the intersectionality of discipline with other social institutions, such as education, religion, and the criminal justice system, to understand how disciplinary practices shape individuals' life chances and trajectories.
