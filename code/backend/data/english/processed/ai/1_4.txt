One of the most significant drawbacks of relying on Soma for societal stability is the suppression of individuality. In the World State, individuality is discouraged, as citizens are conditioned to conform and avoid any form of emotional or intellectual dissent. The constant use of Soma reinforces this conformity, making it nearly impossible for people to express their true feelings or explore their unique identities. The price of societal stability becomes the sacrifice of individual autonomy and personal freedom.
