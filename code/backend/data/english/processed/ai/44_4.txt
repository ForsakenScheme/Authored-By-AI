Moreover, "Oedipus the King" explores the complex interplay between knowledge and ignorance, as Oedipus's relentless pursuit of truth ultimately leads to his downfall. In his quest to uncover the identity of King Laius's murderer, Oedipus unwittingly exposes his own guilt, blinding himself to the consequences of his actions until it is too late. The play serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of excessive pride and the consequences of seeking knowledge beyond our grasp.
