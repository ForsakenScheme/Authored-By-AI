In conclusion, theologies of liberation offer a vibrant and dynamic lens through which students can engage with religious thought and social justice. These frameworks transcend the confines of abstract theological discourse, propelling individuals toward an embodied and transformative spirituality. As students explore the intersection of faith and liberation, they are equipped not only with theological insights but also with a moral imperative to actively participate in the ongoing pursuit of justice, equality, and empowerment.
