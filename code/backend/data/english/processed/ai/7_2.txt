Originality is a cornerstone of academic writing, reflecting our ability to generate new ideas, analyze existing knowledge, and contribute to scholarly discourse. When writing an essay, it is essential to draw upon a diverse range of sources to support our arguments and provide evidence for our claims. However, it is equally important to present these ideas in our own words and offer unique insights that demonstrate our understanding of the topic.
