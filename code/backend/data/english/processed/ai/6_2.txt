The first step in writing a good research paper is to choose a topic that is both interesting and manageable. It's essential to select a topic that aligns with your interests, expertise, and the requirements of your assignment. Take the time to explore different ideas, brainstorm potential research questions, and conduct preliminary research to assess the feasibility and relevance of each topic. Once you've chosen a topic, narrow it down to a specific research question or thesis statement that will guide your investigation.
