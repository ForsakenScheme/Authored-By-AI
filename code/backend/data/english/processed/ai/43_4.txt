Moreover, Housman's use of imagery and symbolism adds depth and resonance to the poem's thematic concerns. The image of the "silken" arms that once bore the athlete in triumph now cradle his lifeless body, serving as a poignant reminder of the fragility and vulnerability of human life. Likewise, the metaphor of the "rose" that is cut down in its prime evokes a sense of beauty and poignancy in the face of mortality, underscoring the tragic inevitability of death's embrace.
