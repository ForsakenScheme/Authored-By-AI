Adoption represents a multifaceted aspect of family life that intersects with broader social, cultural, and legal dynamics. Within the sociology of the family, the study of adoption encompasses various dimensions, including the processes of adoption, the experiences of adoptive families, and the impact of adoption on individuals and society. Sociological research on adoption examines the motivations and decision-making processes of birth parents, adoptive parents, and adopted individuals, exploring factors such as social stigma, infertility, and the desire to build a family through non-biological means.
