War exacts a tremendous human cost, both in terms of lives lost and the deep scars it leaves on survivors and society. The global community must work tirelessly to find diplomatic and cooperative solutions to prevent conflicts and, where they arise, to resolve them peacefully. Promoting awareness of the human cost of war is crucial in building a more peaceful and harmonious world where the devastating consequences of armed conflict are mitigated and eventually eradicated.
