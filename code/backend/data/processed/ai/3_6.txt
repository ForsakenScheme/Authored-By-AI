In addition to taking notes during lectures and readings, it's also important to review and revise your notes regularly. Set aside time each day or week to review your notes, fill in any gaps, and reinforce your understanding of the material. This active review process helps to cement the information in your memory and ensures that you're fully prepared for exams and assignments.
