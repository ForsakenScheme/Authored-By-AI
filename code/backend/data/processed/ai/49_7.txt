Within the sociology of the family, the study of family violence represents a crucial area of inquiry aimed at understanding the complex dynamics surrounding abuse and maltreatment within familial relationships. Family violence encompasses a range of behaviors, including physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, as well as neglect and financial exploitation. Sociological research on family violence examines the root causes, prevalence, and consequences of violence within the family unit, exploring factors such as power dynamics, socialization processes, and cultural norms that contribute to the perpetration of abuse.
