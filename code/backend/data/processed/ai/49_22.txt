Blended families, also known as stepfamilies, represent a common and increasingly prevalent family form in contemporary society. Sociologists study blended families to understand the complexities of family dynamics, relationships, and identity formation within non-traditional family structures. Research in this area explores the challenges and opportunities faced by blended families, including issues of role ambiguity, loyalty conflicts, and boundary management.
