Moreover, the Anglo-Saxon value of loyalty extends beyond individual relationships to encompass broader concepts of kinship and community. In Beowulf, loyalty to one's tribe and kin is portrayed as essential for maintaining social order and cohesion. The bonds of loyalty between Beowulf and his fellow Geats, as well as the reciprocal obligations between rulers and their subjects, underscore the interconnectedness of loyalty and collective well-being in Anglo-Saxon society.
