Research into violence in heterosexual marriages has a long history, dating back to pioneering studies in the mid-20th century. One such landmark study is the work of sociologist Murray Straus, whose research on intimate partner violence (IPV) shed light on the prevalence and impact of violence in heterosexual relationships. Straus's findings highlighted the cyclical nature of violence, with patterns of abuse often repeating over time.
