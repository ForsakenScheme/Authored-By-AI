A central tenet of theologies of liberation is their emphasis on the experiences and perspectives of the oppressed. Grounded in the conviction that God is aligned with the marginalized, these theological frameworks invite students to listen to the voices of those on the margins, to recognize their dignity, and to understand their struggles. Theologies of liberation underscore the interconnectedness of faith and social justice, urging believers to embody compassion and solidarity in their engagement with the world.
