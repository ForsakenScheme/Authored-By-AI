One of the key components of ELA instruction is developing students' reading comprehension skills. This involves teaching students how to analyze and interpret a variety of texts, including fiction, nonfiction, poetry, and drama. Through close reading and textual analysis, students learn to identify key themes, literary devices, and authorial techniques, allowing them to gain deeper insights into the text and its underlying meanings.
