At the heart of global warming lies the enhanced greenhouse effect, a consequence of human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. As a student, comprehending the mechanics of this phenomenon involves unraveling the intricate threads of atmospheric dynamics. Greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane, trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to a gradual warming of the planet. The nuanced relationship between anthropogenic emissions and the resultant temperature rise forms the backbone of the scientific inquiry into global warming.
