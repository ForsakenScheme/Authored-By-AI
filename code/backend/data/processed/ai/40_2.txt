Ã‰mile Durkheim, a pioneer in the field of sociology, emphasized the significance of social cohesion and solidarity in maintaining order within society. His concept of the collective conscience underscores the idea that shared beliefs and values serve as the foundation for social integration. When applied to the discourse on race and rights, Durkheim's theories prompt us to examine how notions of race intersect with societal norms and values to shape collective identities and attitudes towards rights.
