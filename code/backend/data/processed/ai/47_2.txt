One of the most prominent examples of courage in the novel is the moral courage exhibited by Atticus Finch, the principled lawyer who defends Tom Robinson, a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Despite facing intense pressure and backlash from the prejudiced townsfolk, Atticus remains steadfast in his commitment to justice and equality, refusing to compromise his beliefs or integrity. His unwavering moral courage serves as a guiding light for his children, Scout and Jem, as they navigate the complexities of racism and injustice in their community.
