Moreover, as children, we may lack the emotional maturity and coping mechanisms to navigate the complex terrain of grief. We may feel overwhelmed by the intensity of our emotions, unsure of how to express or process them in a healthy and constructive manner. Without the guidance and support of adults who understand our needs and emotions, we may feel isolated and alone in our grief, struggling to find a sense of solace and comfort amidst the pain.
