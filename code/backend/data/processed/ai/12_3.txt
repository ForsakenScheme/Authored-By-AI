Moreover, metaphors play a fundamental role in shaping our cognition and perception of reality. By framing abstract concepts in concrete terms, metaphors provide a mental framework for understanding and interpreting the world around us. For instance, we might describe an argument as "heated" or "fiery," evoking the image of a physical confrontation to convey the intensity of the disagreement. In this way, metaphors help us make sense of our experiences and navigate the complexities of everyday life.
