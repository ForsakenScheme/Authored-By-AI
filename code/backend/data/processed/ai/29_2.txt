At the heart of theologies of liberation lies a commitment to challenging and dismantling oppressive structures, whether they be rooted in economic inequality, racial injustice, or other forms of social stratification. As students delving into these theological frameworks, there is an invitation to interrogate the ways in which religious thought intersects with political and social realities. Theologies of liberation urge individuals to move beyond abstract contemplation and actively confront and transform systems that perpetuate injustice.
