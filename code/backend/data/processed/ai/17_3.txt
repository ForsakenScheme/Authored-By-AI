Moreover, the prevalence of technology has made it easier than ever for students to cheat. With a wealth of online resources and digital tools at our fingertips, the line between legitimate research and academic dishonesty can become blurred. Students may succumb to the temptation to plagiarize or copy answers from online sources in order to save time or avoid the effort of independent thinking and research. The anonymity and perceived impunity of online environments can further embolden students to engage in cheating behaviors, as they may believe they are less likely to be caught or face consequences for their actions.
