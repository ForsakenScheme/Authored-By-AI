In response to these concerns, some jurisdictions have implemented alternative approaches to addressing domestic violence, such as mandatory arrest diversion programs or specialized domestic violence courts. These programs aim to provide support and resources to both victims and perpetrators while holding offenders accountable for their actions. By offering a range of interventions tailored to the needs of each case, these programs seek to address the root causes of domestic violence and prevent future incidents.
