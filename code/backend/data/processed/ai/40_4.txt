Karl Marx, renowned for his critique of capitalism and class struggle, provides invaluable insights into the dynamics of power, exploitation, and inequality within society. Marx's analysis of the capitalist mode of production elucidates how economic relations shape social structures and perpetuate systems of oppression. When applied to the discourse on race and rights, Marx's theories prompt us to interrogate how racialized capitalism perpetuates economic disparities and undermines the realization of rights for racial minorities.
