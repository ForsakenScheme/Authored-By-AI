Once a topic has been chosen, the next step is to develop a research question or thesis statement that will guide the direction of the dissertation. This research question should be clear, concise, and focused, outlining the specific problem or issue that the dissertation aims to address. It is important to conduct a thorough literature review at this stage to familiarize yourself with the existing research on the topic and identify any gaps or areas for further investigation.
