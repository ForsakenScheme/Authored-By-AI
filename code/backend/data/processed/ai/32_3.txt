At its core, design encompasses a broad spectrum of disciplines and practices aimed at solving problems, communicating ideas, and creating meaningful experiences. From graphic design and industrial design to interior design and architecture, design permeates every aspect of our lives, shaping the products we use, the spaces we inhabit, and the messages we encounter. Design is both an art and a science, blending creativity, innovation, and technical skill to craft solutions that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional, intuitive, and impactful.
