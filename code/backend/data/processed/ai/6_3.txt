With a research question in hand, the next step is to conduct a thorough literature review to familiarize yourself with the existing research on the topic. This involves searching for scholarly articles, books, and other relevant sources that provide context, background information, and insights into your research question. Take notes as you read, paying attention to key findings, arguments, and methodologies used by other researchers. Be sure to critically evaluate the quality and reliability of each source and identify any gaps or areas for further investigation.
