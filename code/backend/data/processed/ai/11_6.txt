In addition to its thematic richness, "Doctor Faustus" is renowned for its dramatic structure and innovative use of language. Marlowe's masterful use of blank verse and poetic imagery imbues the play with a sense of grandeur and sophistication, while the juxtaposition of comic and tragic elements adds depth and complexity to the narrative. The character of Mephistopheles, with his sardonic wit and diabolical charm, serves as a compelling foil to Faustus's hubris and folly.
