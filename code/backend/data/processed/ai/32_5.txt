One of the key intersections of design and graphics lies in branding and identity design. A brand's visual identity—comprised of its logo, typography, color palette, and other graphic elements—serves as a powerful tool for conveying its values, personality, and positioning in the market. Through strategic design choices, designers can create cohesive and memorable brand identities that resonate with audiences, foster brand recognition, and differentiate the brand from its competitors.
