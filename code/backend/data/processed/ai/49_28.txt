Disciplining children is a fundamental aspect of parenting that reflects broader cultural norms and values surrounding child-rearing practices. In the sociology of the family, the study of disciplining children examines the various strategies, techniques, and ideologies used by parents to socialize and control their children's behavior. Sociologists explore the cultural and historical roots of disciplinary practices, tracing the evolution of disciplinary norms and attitudes across different societies and time periods.
