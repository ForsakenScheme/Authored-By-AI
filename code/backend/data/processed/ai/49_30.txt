Furthermore, the study of disciplining children extends beyond the family unit to encompass broader social and policy dimensions. Researchers examine the role of institutions, such as schools, healthcare systems, and child welfare agencies, in shaping disciplinary norms and practices. By examining the complexities of disciplining children and its impact on individuals, families, and society, sociologists contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamics of family life and inform policies and interventions aimed at promoting positive parenting practices and child well-being.
