From the outset of the play, Hamlet's erratic behavior and cryptic statements arouse suspicion and intrigue among the characters. The sudden death of his father, King Hamlet, and his mother's hasty remarriage to his uncle, Claudius, propel Hamlet into a state of profound melancholy and disillusionment. It is within this context of grief and betrayal that Hamlet adopts his "antic" disposition, using it as a guise to navigate the treacherous waters of Elsinore and exact his revenge upon Claudius.
