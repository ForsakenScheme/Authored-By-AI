In addition to reading comprehension, ELA instruction also focuses on developing students' writing skills. This includes teaching students how to craft clear, coherent, and persuasive written texts, whether in the form of essays, narratives, or research papers. Through the writing process, students learn to generate ideas, organize their thoughts, and revise their work for clarity and effectiveness. By providing constructive feedback and guidance, teachers help students refine their writing skills and become more proficient communicators.
