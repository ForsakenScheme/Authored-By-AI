At its core, teaching ELA is about fostering a love for language and literature while equipping students with the tools and strategies they need to effectively communicate and comprehend written and spoken texts. This involves engaging students in meaningful and authentic literacy experiences that promote active participation, inquiry, and reflection. Whether through reading novels, writing essays, or participating in class discussions, ELA instruction encourages students to explore the richness and complexity of the English language.
