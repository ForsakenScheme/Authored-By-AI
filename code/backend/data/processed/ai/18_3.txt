The history of Darfur is a tapestry woven with threads of conquest, migration, and coexistence. For centuries, the region was ruled by a succession of sultanates and kingdoms, including the powerful Fur Sultanate, which flourished from the 17th to the 19th century. Under the leadership of the Fur sultans, Darfur emerged as a center of trade, scholarship, and Islamic culture, attracting merchants, scholars, and travelers from across the Sahel and beyond.
