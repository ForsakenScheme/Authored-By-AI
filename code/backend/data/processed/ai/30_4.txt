A central theme of the letter is the concept of "justice too long delayed." Dr. King critiques the clergymen for advocating a gradualist approach to civil rights, emphasizing the urgent need for immediate and comprehensive reform. The letter becomes a clarion call for those who are comfortable with the status quo to recognize the urgency of addressing systemic racial injustice. As students, analyzing this theme prompts reflection on the ethical dimensions of social change and the responsibility of individuals to act in the face of oppression.
