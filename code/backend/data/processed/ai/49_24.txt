Furthermore, the study of blended families extends beyond the domestic sphere to encompass broader social and policy dimensions. Researchers examine the role of institutions, such as schools, healthcare systems, and legal frameworks, in supporting blended families and addressing their unique needs. By examining the complexities of blended families and their impact on individuals, families, and society, sociologists contribute to a deeper understanding of contemporary family dynamics and inform policies and practices aimed at promoting the well-being of all family members.
