At its core, porcelain is a type of ceramic material characterized by its translucent quality and fine texture. Made from a combination of kaolin, feldspar, and quartz, porcelain undergoes a process of firing at high temperatures, resulting in a durable yet exquisitely delicate material. It is this unique combination of strength and fragility that lends porcelain its allure, inviting artists to explore its potential through a myriad of artistic techniques.
