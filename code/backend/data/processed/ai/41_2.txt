"Jane Eyre," set in Victorian England, offers a nuanced exploration of colonialism through its depiction of the colonial enterprise in the character of Bertha Mason, the madwoman confined to the attic of Thornfield Hall. Bertha, a Creole woman from Jamaica, embodies the Otherness and exoticism associated with colonial subjects in the British imagination. Her confinement symbolizes the repression and marginalization of colonial subjects within the metropole, highlighting the power imbalances inherent in colonial relationships.
