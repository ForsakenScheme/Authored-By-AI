In addition, the process of recovering from childhood grief is often facilitated by the passage of time and the gradual acceptance of the loss. As children mature and gain new insights into life and death, they may come to understand that grief is a natural and inevitable part of the human experience, and that it is okay to feel sad, angry, or confused in response to loss. With time, the sharp edges of grief may soften, and children may find moments of joy, laughter, and peace amidst the pain.
