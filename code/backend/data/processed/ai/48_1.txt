The Anglo-Saxons, a Germanic tribe that inhabited England from the 5th to the 11th century, held a multitude of values that shaped their society and culture. Among these values, one of the most prominent is the concept of loyalty. Loyalty, defined as faithfulness and allegiance to one's lord, kin, and community, was considered paramount in Anglo-Saxon society, serving as the bedrock upon which relationships, alliances, and societal cohesion were built.
