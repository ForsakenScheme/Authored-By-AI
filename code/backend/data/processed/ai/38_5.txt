Another criticism of mandatory arrest laws is their one-size-fits-all approach, which fails to account for the complexities of domestic violence cases. Not all situations of domestic violence are the same, and a blanket policy mandating arrest may not always be the most appropriate or effective response. There is a need for a more nuanced and victim-centered approach that takes into consideration the unique circumstances of each case and prioritizes the safety and well-being of all individuals involved.
