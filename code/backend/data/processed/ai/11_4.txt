One of the central themes of "Doctor Faustus" is the pursuit of knowledge and its relationship to morality. Faustus's desire to unlock the secrets of the universe leads him down a dark and dangerous path, blinding him to the ethical implications of his actions. As he delves deeper into the realm of magic and forbidden knowledge, Faustus becomes increasingly isolated from society and consumed by his own ambition.
