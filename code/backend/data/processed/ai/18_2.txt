Darfur is home to a diverse array of ethnic groups, each with its own unique customs, languages, and traditions. The region's population is predominantly composed of three main ethnic groups: the Fur, the Zaghawa, and the Masalit, among others. These communities have coexisted for centuries, sharing common bonds of language, religion, and cultural practices, while also maintaining distinct identities rooted in their respective histories and ancestral lands.
