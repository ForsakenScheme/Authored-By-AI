Social media has become an integral part of our lives, offering both positive and negative impacts on mental health. It can provide connections, support, and mental health awareness, but it can also lead to social comparison, cyberbullying, and information overload. To harness the positive aspects of social media while mitigating its potential risks, individuals must be mindful of their online interactions and practice digital well-being. Society must also continue to explore ways to create a healthier digital environment that promotes mental well-being.
