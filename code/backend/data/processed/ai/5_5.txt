Furthermore, ELA instruction encompasses teaching students how to effectively communicate and collaborate with others through speaking and listening activities. This involves engaging students in meaningful discussions, presentations, and debates that require them to articulate their ideas, listen actively to others, and respond thoughtfully to different perspectives. By honing their speaking and listening skills, students develop the confidence and competence to engage in meaningful dialogue and contribute to the academic community.
