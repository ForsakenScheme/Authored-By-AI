Moreover, scholars investigate the impact of family violence on individuals, families, and communities, highlighting the long-term effects on mental health, intergenerational transmission of trauma, and social isolation. Research in this area also explores the intersectionality of family violence with other forms of social inequality, such as gender, race, class, and sexual orientation, recognizing the ways in which multiple forms of oppression intersect and shape individuals' experiences of abuse. Additionally, sociologists analyze the efficacy of intervention and prevention strategies, advocating for holistic approaches that address underlying social, economic, and structural factors contributing to family violence.
