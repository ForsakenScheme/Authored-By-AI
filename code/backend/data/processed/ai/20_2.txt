As a child, the loss of a loved one can shatter our sense of security and stability, leaving us feeling adrift in a sea of grief and confusion. Whether it's the death of a parent, sibling, grandparent, or friend, the absence of someone we hold dear can leave an indelible void in our lives, one that seems impossible to fill. In the immediate aftermath of loss, we may struggle to make sense of our emotions, grappling with feelings of sadness, anger, guilt, and profound loneliness.
