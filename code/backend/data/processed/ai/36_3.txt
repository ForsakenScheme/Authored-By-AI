Golding employs symbolism throughout the novel to convey deeper themes and ideas about human nature. The conch shell, for example, symbolizes order and authority, serving as a representation of the boys' initial attempts to maintain civilization. However, as the boys' descent into savagery accelerates, the conch loses its power and significance, ultimately shattering into piecesâ€”a poignant metaphor for the collapse of order and the triumph of chaos.
