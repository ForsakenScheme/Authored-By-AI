Moreover, scholars investigate the impact of childfree lifestyles on individuals, couples, and society, examining issues such as relationship satisfaction, social support networks, and economic well-being. Studies also analyze the social stigma and discrimination faced by childfree couples, challenging assumptions about the primacy of parenthood in defining adult identity and fulfillment. Additionally, sociologists explore workplace dynamics and policies that affect childfree individuals, including attitudes towards work-life balance, parental leave policies, and career advancement opportunities.
