Furthermore, metaphors serve as powerful tools for persuasion and influence, shaping our beliefs, attitudes, and behavior. Politicians and advertisers, for example, often use metaphors to evoke emotions and associations that resonate with their audience, persuading them to adopt a particular viewpoint or take a desired action. By tapping into deep-seated cultural metaphors and shared experiences, communicators can effectively convey their message and sway public opinion.
