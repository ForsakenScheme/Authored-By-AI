Another key theme explored in "Doctor Faustus" is the nature of temptation and the allure of worldly pleasures. Throughout the play, Faustus is tempted by the prospect of wealth, power, and sensual gratification, leading him further away from salvation and closer to damnation. His encounters with the Seven Deadly Sins serve as a powerful allegory for the corrupting influence of desire and the inevitability of moral decay.
