While Soma undeniably creates a society where citizens appear happy and content, the question arises: at what cost? Soma's effects are inherently superficial, providing a temporary escape from reality rather than addressing the root causes of dissatisfaction or discontent. In "Brave New World," the citizens' inability to engage with the complexity of human emotions and genuine relationships renders them shallow and ultimately unfulfilled. The pursuit of a "perfect" drug to achieve stability ignores the value of individual experiences and personal growth.
