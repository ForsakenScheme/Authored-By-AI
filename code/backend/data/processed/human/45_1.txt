It's always fun to go to the theater and check out the newest movies, or even head out to the local rental store for a new, interesting movie or an all time favorite. For me, it's different; I'm actually not your average movie fanatic. I actually dislike most movies. To me they all seem to have shallow plot lines, minimal character development, and a distasteful ending most of the time. So it is not usual at all for me to recommend a movie; in fact it's rather rare, but there are movies that I do enjoy and will recommend to another individual. Road to Perdition is one of those few. Tom Hanks, the starring role in this film, is one the actors I don't like at all, though I will admit he did do a good job in this film. Tom Hanks' face is kept half-shadowed by the brim of his fedora, and he is a silent and benign deity of knowledge and wisdom (New York Times.) I'm not one to criticize actors and acting. I honestly can't tell a good actor from a bad one, except if the script is horribly amiss. Some aspects of a movie that I do pay attention to are whether or not it's an action flick, certain themes in the movie, and the setting of the movie.
