As in E. M. Forster's 'Howards End', I too agree with Margaret's reason for building the "Rainbow Bridge", as she tried to connect the two worlds- the inner world of sensation and emotion, with the outer world of material conditions and pragmatic values. As the youth of the modern day are aware of the giant effects of industrialisation and know exactly how much influence the media can create, it is not possible to forgo the advancements and new range of ideas which are brought with it. Other than the commercial value which definitely seeps into the various vehicles of media and communications, whether it is a logo, an ad-film or a book report, ideologies are upheld and beliefs brought out, giving each individual a chance to identify him or her self with something that he or she believes in.
