Beowulf showed selfless qualities even as a young man. When Beowulf is introduced in the story, he is on a journey to "destroy evil wherever it exists, not merely to protect his own people or is own interests." (Moss) Beowulf is willing to risk his life for strangers, which is quite a selfless thing to do. Later on, when Beowulf is getting ready to fight Grendel, he turns to Hrothgar and says, "Great son of Healfdene, hold well in mind The solemn pledge we plighted of old, That if doing your service I meet my death You will mark my fall with a father's love. Protect my kinsmen, my trusty comrades, If battle take me. And all the treasure You have heaped on me bestow upon Hygelac . . ." (Kennedy 980) The last thing Beowulf tells Hrothgar is to take care of his men if he dies in battle. His first thought was towards his men and what would happen if he died. Another example of Beowulf's selflessness is when "Beowulf gave [A battle-sword] to the boat-warden Hilted with gold." (Kennedy 1315) This line seems to come out of the blue, as Beowulf had no reason to give the boat-warden a sword at all.
