Try to work on the dissertation when you have the most energy. If you are tired, rest. If you feel overwhelmed, seek out your advisor or talk to friends. Remember that you are not in competition against fellow class mates. They have their own topics that probably are totally different than what you have chosen. Let them read parts of the dissertation and give feedback about it. Be willing to read theirs if they ask. Ask different instructors about the topic or ask if they would read specific parts of it. Most students and instructors are willing to be helpful.
