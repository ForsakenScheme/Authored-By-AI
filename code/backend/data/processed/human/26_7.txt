However, it is argued that much remains in progress. For the Council to become a preventive rather than a reactive UN body, it needs to gather information from external actors and other UN mechanisms far more efficiently and further increase transparency of its proceedings. So the argument goes that the Council must not only abolish its temporary rules of procedure but also adopt standing rule. Also, it must hold more open meetings. It is also claimed, that it must consider ways to draw support from the Secretariat and to have a more institutionalized presidency. Indeed, it is eminent that the Council increases its transparencies but with the veto power held by the permanent members makes it very difficult for any rapid, radical changes.
