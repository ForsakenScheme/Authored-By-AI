In sum, Prunier's article offers some valuable insight to the situation occurring in Darfur, while providing a pleasant contrast to the sugar-coated and watered-down version fed to us by the market-driven media. Though the majority of the paper is informative, the author makes a very important point: unless the international community does something to remedy this bloodbath, the Darfuri people may continue to suffer their plight for decades.
