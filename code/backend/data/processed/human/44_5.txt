Teiresias actually plays an important role in the story, as he foreshadows what will happen to Oedipus, and he helps show that sight is a symbol for knowledge: "I am not sure that the blind man can not see." (40) Oedipus says about Teiresias when he begins to realize that Teiresias may have been right about him. This shows that sight is used as a representation for knowledge because Oedipus is saying that Teiresias may be speaking the truth, for when he says "can not see" he may actually mean 'does not know the truth'.
