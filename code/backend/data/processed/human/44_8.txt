In conclusion, sight and blindness are very significant in Oedipus the King and are the center theme of the play as a whole. The play brings up the point that intellectual blindness is worse the physical blindness; a physically blind person, such as Teiresias, knows that he is blind and can cope without sight, while an intellectually blind person, such as Oedipus, does not even know he is blind, and can do nothing about it since he is unaware of his disadvantage. Intellectual blindness will almost always mean ignorance, and once Oedipus overcomes his blindness, he can only wonder if things would have been different if he had seen the truth. This question of whether a person's fate can be changed or avoided is the key question that the play brings up, and it all comes down to sight and blindness.
