A career in law and security administration gives me the opportunity to change the local community for the better. First of all, working in this profession will let me apply my already high moral standards, beliefs, and principles for the betterment of society. Such as the goodness, equality, freedom, truth, and justice principles which are deserved by everyone in treatment. Secondly, I as an agent of the law will be able to serve and protect the people. Decreasing crime with the help of the public will result in a lower percentage of fear and a feeling of a safer environment. Lastly, the public will see me as a role model, and I will take pride and honour in knowing this fact. There is nothing better than knowing you changed society's view and trust toward law enforcement officials.
