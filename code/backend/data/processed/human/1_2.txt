In a perfect society, humans do not need to resort to drugs to keep society in balance. In Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, society is based on keeping everyone happy- and if for some reason someone becomes unhappy then there is always soma- the "perfect" drug. Humans are conditioned from the very start to be happy while performing their specific tasks. "We also predestine and condition. We decant out babies as socialized human beings, as Alphas or Epsilons, as future sewage workers or future Directors of Hatcheries." (Page 13) Brave New World's society is built on keeping everyone happy and keeping everyone working in balance with civilization. However, without soma, Brave New World's society wouldn't function properly. The soma helps to keep the society moving, always working to keep production moving, just like Ford's assembly line. However, there something wrong with depending on a drug to keep a society working.
