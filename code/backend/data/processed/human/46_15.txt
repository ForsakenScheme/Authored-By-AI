Greater efficiencies are achieved when applications are standardised across both organisations. This means one ERP system, one mail system and one document management system amongst others. Key considerations will include data conversion from a replaced system to the new one and backward compatibility. This means a few machines might need to be kept with the old application installed to look back to prior years' data if all data is not converted to the new system.
