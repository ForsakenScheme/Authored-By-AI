Throughout the centuries, the Bible has proven as an inspirational text for Christians. Furthermore, when the Bible is studied, it is clear that its message has developed into a clearer and elaborate work. One of the ways that this is done is through the use of an eclectic (wide range) of texts. At times, biblical eclecticism can be useful to inspire and decipher confusing issues in the Bible. However, an eclectic use of texts can at times prove problematic and be misinterpreted, leading to a warped personal rather than spiritual meaning.
