Dostoyevsky also addresses the presence of criminality in different social ranks and seeks to classify and unite them under the common ideal that all humankind retains a communal "original sin". The author plainly outlines by way of Rodya himself that there are two types of criminal, man, and evil; that of the "extraordinary" and that of the ordinary. Dostoyevsky writes, "People with new ideas, people with the faintest capacity for saying something new, are extremely few in number, extraordinarily so in fact. One thing only is clear, that the appearance of all these grades and sub-divisions of men must follow with unfailing regularity some law of nature." (132). It is here, the author clearly states two facts that allow the reader to view his philosophies. One such philosophy, being that "ordinary" and "extraordinary" men exist, though not in equal rations, and they are both bound by "some law of nature". The novel gives evidence that a law of nature, rather than a law of the intellect, or a law of society controls man, whether he be ordinary or extraordinary. "Do men go to commit a murder as I went then? I will tell you some day how I went! Did I murder the old woman? I murdered myself, not her! I crushed myself once for all, for ever. . . . But it was the devil that killed that old woman, not I..."(211), here Rodya describes the driving force behind his crime and ominously identifies the true murderer which he religiously depicts as "the devil" which can be viewed as a metaphor for the "devil" inside every person. Physically yes, Rodya was the killer and he understands this despite his monomania, however perceiving his words in a more psychological sense and examining this quote with the earlier, the reader is able to add them up and discover the sum to be yet another way in which Dostoyevsky solidifies the theme that men have a collective soul that is innately a breeding-ground for evil.
