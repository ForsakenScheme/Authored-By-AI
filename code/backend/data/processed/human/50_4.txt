Likewise, Dostoyevsky makes evident that religion, in true nihilist theory, cannot compensate or "save" man from this fundamental and natural turpitude. Even Friedrich Nietzsche the alleged father of nihilism and elemental influence on the novel states, "To the clean are all things clean' - thus say the people. I, however, say unto you: To the swine all things become swinish!...For these are all unclean spirits..." And because it is an essential belief in nihilism that there is no substantial God, when Dostoyevsky writes, "At seven the child is vicious and a thief. Yet children, you know, are the image of Christ: 'theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.' He bade us honor and love them, they are the humanity of the future. . . ."(320), the intrinsic theme which the author attempts to convey is basically that God and religion play no part in the evil of humanity and faith can neither prevent nor cure that which people are born with- the capacity for evil. He does so by illustrating the corruption of children, (who are the picture of innocence or "the image of Christ"), and how they can be wicked and yet this wickedness is not due to their choice of sin over piousness, but rather something inborn; another nihilistic psychology that dictates man exists simply to survive, for there is no rationale in the world. By rule, religion is a structure that is wholly based upon rationalization and serves as an explanation of the mechanics of the world people live in. Therefore, logically the reader is able to see the linear yet subtle argument that Dostoyevsky employs to provide evidence that evil is not as "sinful" as religion would have it, but rather a quality mankind is born with and thus ingrained in its psychology allowing reason and elucidation for the "monomania" Rodya experiences without a spiritual pretext.
