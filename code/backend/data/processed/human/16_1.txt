What is the career that most appeals to you? Most people have considered some type of career earlier in life, but I on the other hand did not really have a good idea of what I would do for the rest of my life. In fact I had chosen law and security administration near the end of high school. There will be many future job openings in this career; therefore, I believe that a career in law and security administration would best suit me. I chose this because I will be able to make changes to the local community, because of the influence of friends and family, and of personal and financial rewards.
