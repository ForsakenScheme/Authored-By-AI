The Savage is not happy with the life that the "civilized" people live. To him it seems like a big illusion. The people are conditioned to not have emotions, but humans cannot really be humans without emotions. Humans are different from all the other creatures in this world because they do indeed have emotions. The advanced human brain has allowed people to have emotions- which affect their lives daily. "The emotions aren't always immediately subject to reason, but they are always immediately subject to action" (William James) The Savage had several chances to "have" Lenina any time he wanted but he didn't want that. He wanted passion, he wanted somebody to love, and most importantly he didn't want to rely on soma to keep him happy.
