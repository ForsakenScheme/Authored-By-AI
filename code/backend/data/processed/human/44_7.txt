This idea of denial and willingness to see is thought-provoking; throughout the play Iocaste and Oedipus both choose whether to open their eyes to the truth, or intentionally be blind towards it. It takes Oedipus the entire play to permit his eyes to see the truth of his past, and when he finally does, he immediately chooses to blind himself, maybe as a symbol for the blissful ignorance he once had.
