I think peer pressure is also in the mix but in a far different way. I remember from my own grad school experience that I would often look around the classroom and wonder if I was keeping up with everyone else. I wanted so much to do well that I found myself studying unusually long hours in order to do well. I never resorted to cheating but I could see why people do it.
