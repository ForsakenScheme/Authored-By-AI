Madness is a condition in which is difficult to identify whether it is true or not. As in the encounter of the ghost of Hamlet's father and Hamlet, Hamlet is asked to avenge his father's death. To accomplish this task in a less apparent manner, Hamlet decides to put an antic disposition on. Consequently, his behavior thereafter is frequently baffling. William Shakespeare, the writer of the tragic play Hamlet leaves the audience to decide whether Hamlet is truly mad or not. Throughout Shakespeare's Hamlet, Hamlet's questionable madness is explored through his real madness, feigned actions, and the reactions of others towards his madness.
