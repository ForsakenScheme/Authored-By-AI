Within this movie there is plenty of death. Being a movie about a conflict between mob members, it is hit men killing hit men. Along with this constant killing the director plays with the mood to soften the intensity of having someone just die either on screen or off screen. That mood softener is water. "He creates a limbo of darkness, shadow, night, fearful faces half-seen, cold and snow," expertly states Roger Ebert. This movie does contain a feel of dark times and a constant foreboding of death. The second theme many fathers can relate to is the ties between father and son. "It's a natural law," Kenneth Turan, movie reviewer for the Los Angeles Times, highlights. "Sons are put on this earth to trouble their fathers." Whether it is a relationship between biological or surrogate, Michael Sr. was taken in by John Rooney (Paul Newman) a mobster kingpin and close associate to Al Capone. Rooney keeps Michael under his wing and teaches his ways and life style to Michael. This comes to an abrupt end when Michael Jr. hides and is found when Michael Sr. is on the job during a bloody murder. This then causes a rift between Rooney and Michael Sr. leaving a lack of trust. Michael and his son are forced to flee for their lives because of Michael Jr. having knowledge of what his dad does for a living.
