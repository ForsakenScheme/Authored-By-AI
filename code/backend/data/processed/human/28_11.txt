Having three accounts of the same story is advantageous because it allows a reader to have a choice to understand and learn about the life of Jesus. Some people may like se the Bible as a prophetic and spiritual text so they may prefer the styling of Matthew. However, some people may want Luke's quick account of what happened during the calming of the storm. Either way, there is a choice for Christians as passages such as these are easily accessible to them. Also, it makes it easier to present to an intended audience as one can choose which passage is most appropriate and inspirational. For example, if a priest is delivering a sermon on faith, he may choose Matthew's account as it more inspiring as opposed to a Mark's account which is more suitable for a classroom environment. Despite this, eclectic texts of the same passage can be troublesome at time. Questions can arise such as which is more authoritative or more reliable.
