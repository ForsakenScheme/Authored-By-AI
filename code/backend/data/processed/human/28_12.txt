Overall, biblical eclecticism has its strengths and weaknesses. Using a wide range of texts can be uplifting to some people. Texts like Job and Exodus can help Christians feel comforted at times of hurt and suffering. It can also provide as a sanctuary of peace and comfort, providing hope and joy in the kindness of God. Regardless, biblical eclecticism can also be used for political and personal satisfaction through misunderstanding the moral of the stories. Some people use texts (like Luke and Matthew) to present their own perspective on biblical accounts. Furthermore, passages can be weaved and manipulated to present a warped and tarnished account of true events. These are then presented as a basis for a certain standpoint that does not account for their true meaning, but for what someone wants them to believe. Biblical eclecticism is like a two edged sword, it can be used for good and also for evil but it must be up to the reader to decide which is which.
