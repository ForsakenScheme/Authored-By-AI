As the Latin American society developed, it was the great majorities (proletariats) of these countries that immensely suffered. The result of this led to the creation of the liberational movements seeking major changes in the social and economical stature of their respective countries. However, it was until the late 1960s that the church in Latin America gave any hope to the plight of Liberation Theology through the documents of two conferences. Firstly, there was the Consejo Episcopal Latino Americano (CELAM) held at Medellín, Colombia in 1968. This conference at Medellín asserted the church would make a preferential option for the poor and this was the first hope of liberation. Following this conference was the one held at Puebla, Mexico in 1979. The Pope praises the changes and work done since Medellín. The Puebla conference was held by Pope John Paul II who critiqued Liberation Theology. He felt that the gospel had been re-read and misinterpreted too many times and misinterpretations segregate the kingdom of God from the church. He praised the work of Latin American but not the goals of Liberation Theology as they were too political.
