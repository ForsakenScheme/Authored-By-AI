It seems to me that the prevention of pollution for a natural power source would alone be enough to build a dam. The author does not realize that "over 20 million people living in the Southwest U.S. depend upon Lake Powell for an ensured water supply and their economic well being." However I feel the author over looks this in his naturalist point of view. He also fails to provide any facts are statistics on wildlife damage. Which seems that all his statements are based on his personal point of view and not as a whole. The author states that nature will find a way to restore itself, but in the meantime and power sourceis needed for humans. And it can either be provided through safe clean ways as or by the damaging polluting ways.
