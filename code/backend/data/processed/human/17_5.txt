I also think there are levels of cheating. Some people may cheat once and their conscience never lets them forget it. Then, there are some who cheat regularly, or semi-regularly and don't even worry about it. In the end, I think it's a problem that has social and psychological roots and it very much depends on a long list of factors - who the person has been in the past; if they've ever cheated or broken the law before; their upbringing; their values and their emotional stability.
