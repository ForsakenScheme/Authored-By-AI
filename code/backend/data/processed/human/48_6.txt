Beowulf showed the quality of selfless bravery throughout his life. This quality caused him to be made king. It caused him to be respected by his subjects. Beowulf was shown respect by his retainer Wiglaf, who was himself selflessly brave as he fought the dragon with Beowulf. It is interesting that we still appreciate the value of selflessness in our society as is seen through our emulation of Mother Theresa, Bea Gaddy, and the requirement of service learning hours in order to graduate. Apparently, we are still and Anglo-Saxon society. Selflessness was an important value in the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf and is still considered to be an important value today.
