At the school level, particularly in grades 9 ï 12, i.e. the GCE O and A Levels, I was taught Art and Design. Our main area of study was fine art ï painting in various media including watercolor, acrylic and poster, drawing and sketching in pencil, charcoal and contï crayons. Our works stretched from copying Old Masters' Paintings to still life to live human figure drawing and even extended to our school educational trips. We went to Vizag, (Vishakhapatnam) in Andhra Pradesh in India, and another year we went to Panchmari in Madhya Pradesh. Both places are very different, as the former is a seaside spot and the latter is a colder mountainous region. Our art teacher accompanied us and it was our job to constantly carry a notebook for our recording purpose. It became a journal where we made sketches whenever possible. This became one of our most important exercises and we were later asked to submit a paper with supporting visuals. This included references to the enticing Rishikonda Beach, the temples, the Borra Caves and also the Vishakha Museum at Vizag. Photographs acted as our most important visual documentation.
