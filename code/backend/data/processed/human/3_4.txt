Make notes as brief as possible or create your own shorthand. Most of the time shorthand does not work for taking notes. However, it does help to use abbreviations or symbols. However, remember what these abbreviations or symbols mean when you rewrite the notes. Some students use outlines as a way to take notes. Write down key points in class and review these key points after class.
