Dedicated management staff are constantly on the lookout for companies they can merge with or acquire. Little thought is given to the integration of the merging firms' business process and systems at the initial stages. The emphasis at this point is on share prices, balance sheet size, profits, products' range, market dominance, position in the market and potential costs savings from the merger or acquisition. This last position (i.e. potential cost savings) is particularly important and be greatly enhanced when the business processes and IT systems of organisations involved in mergers or acquisitions are effectively streamlined and integrated to remove duplication and maximise existing resources.
