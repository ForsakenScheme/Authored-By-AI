My friends and family were an enormous impact on one of my biggest decisions in life. Firstly, I had heard stories from my mother of how my family back home, mainly my aunts and uncles, that are all high ranked cops or in the military. This made me wonder if I should consider pursuing a career in one of those due to genetics. Secondly, I would not have chosen to enter law enforcement if it was not for a friend who advised me to do so. After much conscious debate on my decision towards entering law enforcement, my friend's advice was the last reason I needed to choose to enter law and security administration. Lastly, during high school, another friend of mine was leaving to join the army. This both surprised and inspired me. In my opinion he did not seem like someone who would fit in the military, yet there he was wearing the uniform and backpack and ready to go. This changed my opinion on a lot of things and made me reconsider my future plans.
