The first step in writing a research paper is choosing the topic. Some instructors assign the topic, but even then there is room to be more specific. One way to choose a topic is to brainstorm. What do you know about the topic? What do you want to know? Spend ten to fifteen minutes brainstorming and then choose a topic from this. Another way to choose a topic is to freely write for five to ten minutes about what you know about the topic and what you would like to learn. Select a topic from this.
