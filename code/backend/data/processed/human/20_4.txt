These feelings proceed into the second phase of acute grief which has a combination of elements of feelings endured by the bereaved child. Though no one feeling is more important than the other, there is one important fact and that is no to suppress any of the feelings and try to work around them even though one feeling might intercept the next. As children may need more time to overcome their grief in comparison to adults, it needs to be told that these feelings and experiences are common occurrence and need to be expressed. Yearning and pining happens when the child has hopes and dreams of turning back the clock to before the death when their life was 'normal' before the person died. They may relate to T.V. characters and hope their problem will be 'fixed' at the end as a sense of disbelief at the outcome. One other element may be searching for the loved one at the house or place they would have normally resided at and possibly to remember certain memories or in hope that by doing something to reclaim the deceased they might be able to bring them back. Part of this grieving process is also anger. Anger at the parents, the teacher, God and blaming the deceased for the trouble they have caused to the existing family structure. Anger and blame co-inside with one another and may rise unexpectedly. Guilt can also deepen the child's feelings as they cope with blaming themselves for the death. They may be inclined to presume they are responsible for the death for not being 'kind' enough or simply for bad behaviour and they are now being punished.
