The Anglo-Saxon value of selflessness is still upheld in modern times. This is shown by the esteem to which selfless people have been held. Mother Teresa was a shining example of a selfless individual. She began working to help other people from a very young age, and has always tried to help others. She became the icon for selflessness and even received a nobel prize because of her work. In Maryland, Bea Gaddy was a woman who worked selflessly to feed the poor. She was even called "the Mother Teresa of Baltimore." The importance of selflessness as a virtue is shown through the public school system's requirements of service learning hours for their students to graduate from high school.
