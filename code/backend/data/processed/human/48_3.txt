These selfless characteristics show themselves later in Beowulf's leadership style. Beowulf was chosen to be king because he had immense selflessness which was shown in his bravery, and the people "held individual bravery above all." (Moss) Beowulf also never backed down from a fight. People at that time believed that "a coward suffered the deepest shame." (Wissolik) Beowulf never ran from a fight, even the fight with the dragon that he lost. Beowulf also showed his selflessness when he was dying from the fight with the dragon. Beowulf said, "For this goodly treasure whereon I gaze I give my thanks to the Lord of all, To the Prince of glory, Eternal God, Who granted me grace to gain for my people Such dower of riches before my death." (Kennedy 1700) The first thing Beowulf had to say to his retainer (Wiglaf) when he was dying was how he was glad that he had acquired all this gold for his people.
