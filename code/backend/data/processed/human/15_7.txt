Without going into too much detail, there are a few theories that seem to describe the comparison of adolescence and the Enlightenment. Erik Erikson characterized adolescent as time of identity v. role confusion. This means that the basic issue for adolescents is the formation of identity. Anna Freud described "storm and stress" as an essential part of adolescence. In these ways I find a direct reflection of the progression of human development on a larger scale during the Enlightenment and on a more microscopic level a progression of human development as it is observed in adolescence for our society. I do wonder if it is a direct effect of the way of thinking during the Enlightenment Era though that the formation of adolescence, and the study of it was developed? If not developed in theory would it have existed silently without acknowledgement?
