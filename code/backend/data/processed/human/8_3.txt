I've always had an affinity towards science, especially biology. I've found that both my propensity for argument and cynical disposition are assets in a field where theories are always tentative and subject to change. These qualities helped me advance to District on all three of the Science Fair experiments I have conducted. Something about biology (I still haven't found exactly what) especially called to me, and I signed up for AP Bio at the earliest possible chance. Our teacher, Dr. Baker, had worked for several years as a nano-biologist and was determined to show us the technological side of the subject. I thoroughly enjoyed many of the experiments we conducted, and decided to explore the field of Biomedical Engineering since it appealed to many of my interests, combining biology with technology.
