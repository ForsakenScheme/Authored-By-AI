The organisation experienced a significant loss of revenues and almost came to a standstill. The situation deteriorated progressively and culminated with the replacement of the senior management team in 1999. In 2000, Waste Management deployed a new IT architecture and for the first time developed an acquisition strategy that matched its IT capabilities. This new architecture has allowed the organisation to quickly absorb subsequently acquired organisations.
