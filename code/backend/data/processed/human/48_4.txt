As Beowulf fights his final battle, his retainer Wiglaf shows "bravery, loyalty, and devotion." (Moss) This loyalty takes the form of selflessness as Wiglaf ignores his own safety and helps Beowulf kill the dragon. During the fight, Wiglaf is referred to as Beowulf's "shoulder-companion," (Kennedy 1615) which is a usual term for a sword. This shows that Beowulf thought of Wiglaf as his 'right-hand man.' Wiglaf showed his loyalty to Beowulf by putting his life in jeopardy during the final battle to help Beowulf.
