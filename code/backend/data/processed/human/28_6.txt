Through passages such as these has led to historical movements such as Black Theology. Black Theology's use of Biblical text provides a strong, religious argument in the cause of emancipating the oppressed black people. The main passages that were used in Black Theological cause is found in Job as well as Exodus, where God freed the oppressed Israelites from the reign of their Egyptian slave masters. Although, it was through hardship and the challenges as well as plagues that Moses inflicted upon the pharaoh and his people. Passages such as these reminded them that God interacts with human life (especially when under oppression of the fellow man.) Its cause was also supported by Acts 17:26 where it says "He made from one all the nations of mankind to live on all the face of the earth." The Bible teaches Christians that there is only one race --the human race-- regardless of size, shape or colour. This use of biblical knowledge theology shows a strong religious perspective in support Black Theology. In high sight, Black Theology had opened up the eyes of black and white people, making them both ware that their way of life was cruel and unjust. Also, were it not for Black Theology, perhaps it would be a very different society that we live in today.
