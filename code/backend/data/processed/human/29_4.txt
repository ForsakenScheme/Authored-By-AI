Also, Black Theology's use of biblical text provides a strong, religious argument in the cause of emancipating the oppressed black people. The main passage that is used in Black theological cause is found in Exodus, where God freed the oppressed Israelites from the reign of their Egyptian slave masters. Passages such as these remind us that God interacts with human life (especially when under oppression of the fellow man.) Black Theology's cause is also supported by Acts 17:26 where it says "He made from one all the nations of mankind to live on all the face of the earth." The Bible teaches Christians that there is only one race --the human race-- regardless of size, shape or colour. This use of biblical knowledge theology shows a strong religious perspective in support Black Theology which encourages hope through liberation.
