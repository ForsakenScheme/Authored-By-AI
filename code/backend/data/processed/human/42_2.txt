In some instances, Hamlet's madness can be seen as real. For example, Hamlet states as he makes a pass through the arras and kills Polonius, "How now! a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!" (3.4, 25). Hamlet's madness is no longer feigned when he does not kill Claudius and instead kills Polonius, the wrong person, in such a rash manner. In addition, Hamlet murders without sight of what he is doing, which displays his loss of reason for putting an antic disposition on. Nevertheless, Hamlet could have had been mad before he puts an antic disposition. As is evident in the beginning of the play, Horatio and Marcellus try to hold Hamlet back, but Hamlet rebels. Hamlet states, "Still am I called. Unhand me, gentlemen--/ Heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!/ I say, away" (1.4, 84-86). Hamlet puts himself at risk and does not think about the consequences. With the purpose to walk towards the ghost and without contemplation, his behavior is thoughtless and rash, the characteristics of madness. His madness is further evident when he submits to his desire rather than reason through threatening those who hinder him from seeing the ghost as he wishes.
