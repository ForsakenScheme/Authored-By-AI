Before the trial, Atticus went through numerous confrontations. He had to stand up against his friends like Heck Tate, and faced dissuasion from lots of his neighbours, but he stood firmly on his ground, unwavering of his decision. The night before the trial, Atticus even went to the jailhouse unarmed to personally guard Tom Robinson from the white mob; he risked himself as his family through so much danger that Mr. Underwood, a man, unsupportive of Atticus's defence for Tom Robinson, decided to protect him with a shotgun. Atticus was not obligated by law to protect his client, but he took on the responsibility so that his client could be judged in court, not by physical action, the kind of courage that Maycomb took as priority. Atticus put himself in danger's way to let the truth be told. Moral courage is Atticus's best asset, making him the most respectable keeper of justice in Maycomb.
