Second, almost all of Mark's Gospel is contained in Matthew or Luke. Matthew reproduces almost 90 percent of Mark; Luke includes around 50 percent of Mark. Only three or four of Mark's periscopes (small units of material) do not appear in one of the other two Synoptics. It is easier to believe that Mathew and Luke expanded Mark than to accept that Mark would have omitted so much material contained in Matthew and Luke.
