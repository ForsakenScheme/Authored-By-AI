The information that will be sent to the consumer will be primarily determined by the profile that is constructed by our evolving personalized information construct. A search will be conducted for the users profile on our databases upon a registered user’s login to the website. Our databases can essentially house limitless amounts of information on limitless profiles on each and every user registered with the website. The profiles consist of people’s hobbies, social networks, internet surfing habits, location and general interests, they even expand to the smallest details, such as the amount of time they spend on the internet every day and at what sites they spend it at. Based on this detailed profile, information will be delivered to the users’ computer in accordance with their specified areas on interest. All of this is done with minimal user interaction from both a consumer and employees perspective and relies almost entirely on our dynamically evolving artificial intelligence engine.
