In Gerard Prunier's article, "Did Somebody Say Genocide?" there is a huge lack of the author's actual opinion. Though through his diction and vocabulary, you can sense the author's viewpoint regarding the situation, there are few places in the article where he actually says it outright. One point however, where I differ with the author, is his proposed definition of the word "genocide", which calls for "...a coordinated attempt to destroy a racially, religiously, or politically predefined group in its entirety," limiting the otherwise very broad (yet necessary) definition of genocide. If this definition was officially adopted into international politics and diplomacy, our political leaders would be even less obliged to do anything about it (if that is possible).
