In my eyes this sort of active participation in events, even colonization, was a necessary part of development for the Western World in order to attain the identity achieved today. I say this not necessarily in favor of westernization. Along with identity, adolescence is a time where the definition of an individual moral code is struggled with in development before it is achieved. Influence of moral development has many different venues. Early on in life a person experiences core moral influences from their family, much like the early moral influences of the church as family on pre-modern Europe. As the individual attends school and becomes more autonomous, the organization and formation of social support networks moves away from support from the family structure and shifts more toward school and peer influence. As Europe became more autonomous and began to think and question for themselves, a similar shift occurred from influence of societal moral influence, moving away from the church towards scientific reasoning. This was autonomy of society also known as the beginning of the separation of church and state, which supposedly has pull in the current democratic society of the United States. This separation is by no means denouncing religious belief just as the child now more influenced by peers does not mean that there is no moral guidance form their parents.
