"The cynic is one who never sees a good quality in a man and never fails to see a bad one. He is the human owl, vigilant in darkness and blind to light ... The cynic puts all human actions into two classes - openly bad and secretly bad." (Henry Ward Beecher) My personality could probably best be described as quirkily cynical. I can't say I'm quite as misanthropic as Beecher describes, but I do have numerous traits (read: quirks) that would give the appearance of overflowing cynicism.
