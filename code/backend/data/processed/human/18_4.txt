Even just by scanning his article, it is clear to any reader that Prunier's intended audience was a well educated and informed one, specifically in the areas of history, politics, and current events. The author's intention here is to speak as a current-events specialist to others who are in the same (or related) fields, with his primary purpose being largely informative; to educate readers with a more detailed account of the tragedy, the internal events that caused it, media and diplomatic response, and the recent developments of the genocide. Though the article is primarily intended for a historical-enthusiast audience, it is quite possible (with some dictionary-browsing and brief research) to wade through the sea of names, organizations, and vocabulary and come to a coherent understanding of the editorial. Given the fact that this article was published in an issue of Current History, a magazine devoted to world affairs, it can be assumed that the genre of Prunier's writing is mainly that of an intellectual nature; designed specifically to cater to those who are familiar with areas of politics and international relations.
