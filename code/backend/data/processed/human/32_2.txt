It is true that the roots of contemporary graphic design are centuries old, taking us far back to the royal regalia, national flags, heraldry, tapestries and stained-glass windows of the Church, using symbols that uphold beliefs and stress authority. However, since the 1940's, graphic design has expanded. Its products have transformed drastically the psychological and creative life of people. The superiority and rise of technique in media has made graphic design a prevailing sway. I would like to contribute to society by communicating ideologies through my visualizations. Even a person in the street has become an expert at handling visual metaphors and graphic puns through the media of communications, newsprint, magazines and advertising.
