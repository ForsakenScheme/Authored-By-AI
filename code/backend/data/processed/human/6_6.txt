The first step in writing a rough draft is to start with the first paragraph. A first paragraph should begin with an attention-getter. This can be an interesting fact, statistics, or anecdote. However, some professors want the thesis as the first part of the paragraph. Ask to be sure whether the professor wants the thesis first or to use an attention-getter.
