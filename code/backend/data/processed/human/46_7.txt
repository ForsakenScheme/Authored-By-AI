Organisations involved in mergers and acquisitions usually have cost savings as one of the desired outcomes of the process. When the organisation involved belong to the same industry (e.g. the banking industry), there is a need to reduce the back office costs (e.g. call centres) of the combined entity (McGinn, 2008). Other expectations include expected savings in infrastructure and headcount with the combined IT entity being expected to deliver improved performance that adequately supports the business requirements after the merger or acquisitions (Siemens, 2004).
