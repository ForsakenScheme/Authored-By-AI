Others told me, anim誰 is not a real form of art, not a real form of literature. So I choked down my arguments and hid my sketches. Slowly, though, I came to realize, anim誰 is part of my heritage; a part of my passion for art. There is worth and beauty in anything that a person holds passion for. It is anim誰 that began my love and admiration for other forms of art. A manga is a one-man film, the size, shape, angle, and character in each frame delicately intertwined with story. And within each frame is a work of art 誰 ink, motion, toning, and expression.
