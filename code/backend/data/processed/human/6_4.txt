Begin reading the research material. Use this information to help you create a thesis and to create an outline. A thesis is a road map showing what the paper will be discussing. What is the focus of the topic? What are the three main points? An essay on eating disorders might have the following thesis: Many teenage girls develop eating disorders because they have poor body image, low self-esteem, and no self-confidence. Notice this is a roadmap because it is telling the read that he or she will be reading about teenage girls with eating disorders. Secondly, it is telling the reader that three specific things cause eating disorders in teenagers. This gives the three main points.
