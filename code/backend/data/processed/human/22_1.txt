Orwell's prejudice against the colonized is inexcusable. In his essays "Shooting an Elephant," "Marrakech," and "A Hanging," Orwell demonstrates his prejudice against the colonized. When he describes their deaths, he reveals just how insignificant he thinks they are. Even when Orwell becomes one of the colonized, he continues to be prejudice and show his inhumane attitude toward the trivial colonized. There are many aspects to focus on in his essays, but it's difficult to ignore the prejudice undertone.
