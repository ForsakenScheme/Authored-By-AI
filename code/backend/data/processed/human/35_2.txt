I want to pursue undergraduate study in visual arts, majoring in the Graphic Design course, particularly in the Savannah College of Art & Design, in Atlanta. What appeals to me about the Graphic Design course offered at Savannah, is the range of flexibility to suit my interests. It would help me to pursue my career goals in this field, and emerge as an artist. Savannah would act as my guide, not only giving me a strong design-oriented foundation, but also give me the chance to hone my skills and develop in me the characteristics required for a design success. It would be an important opportunity to study in a hub city like Atlanta, where I would not only gain first hand experience, but a major plus point would be the rich cultural and ethnic diversity. This would provide a further educational aspect in terms of intellectual exposure. Cultural variety would supply a number of extended angles to each social and sociological issue represented in my artworks. Since material conditions are unavoidable, the obvious mercantile value is bound to enter the various means of media and communications. However, logos, ad-films, web pages or even radio jingles, are ultimately enforcing ideologies which then hit the thinking sides of people. Therefore, design and communication make it possible for each person to recognize him or her self with something that he or she believes in.
