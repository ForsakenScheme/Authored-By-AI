Overall, Dostoyevsky with his nihilistic novel postulates and supports the ideal that every man, woman, and child is born with the capacity for great evil, and inevitably will fall to some degree to it. However, the author also indicates that free will constitutes that by which a person is bound to his or her personal evil and offers a delicately hopeful prospect. While mankind does retain a darker psychological make-up, nihilistically it is strictly up to an individual to control their actions and thus their outcome. As Carl Jung, the revolutionary psychiatrist once summed, "Enlightenment is not imagining figures of light but making the darkness conscious."
