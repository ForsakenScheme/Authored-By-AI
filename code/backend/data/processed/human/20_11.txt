In the last stage, subsiding grief, the child is starting to organize themselves back into their routine and the loss and bereavement integrates and they start to accept the outcome. To reach this stage may require additional help from outside sources to create a positive integration. They start to concentrate better and understand their loss as part of life and adjust to their surroundings once again. As a teacher there are many roles and can be difficult at times especially if bereavement occurs as this affects the whole class.
