Orwell's essay, "Shooting an Elephant" takes place in Moulmein Burma, now called the Union of Myanmar which is located in Southeast Asia. The essay begins when he is called to the other side of town, where an otherwise tame elephant has run rampant. When he arrives, he is briefed on the elephant's mayhem, and proceeds to question the townspeople about the elephant's location. When he gets contradicting stories about the elephant's whereabouts he says, "That is invariably the case in the East; a story always sounds clear enough at a distance, but the nearer you get to the scene of events the vaguer it becomes." He is referring to everyone who lives in the east. This statement illustrates his prejudice. Then he stumbles upon a dead Burman man, who he describes as a "black Dravidian coolie," that had been trampled by the elephant. Then he explicitly details the carnage. According to Encarta, an internet dictionary, "Dravidian" is defined as "a family of languages spoken in Southern India," and a "Coolie" is defined as "an offensive term for an employee who is treated as merely one of many unworthy of concern." At the end of the essay, Orwell tracks down the elephant and kills it with an elephant rifle. When he thinks about the consequences he might face for killing the elephant he says that "... [he] was very glad that the coolie had been killed; it put [him] legally in the right and it gave [him] a sufficient pretext for shooting the elephant." This statement shows that he did not care that a man had died; rather he was happy to be able to use the accident to justify his actions.
