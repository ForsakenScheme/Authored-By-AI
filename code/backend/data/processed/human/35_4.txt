Preparing for our lengthy 16 hours exam was always very demanding in patience and tested our persistence. The module was concerned with developing the student's visual stimuli and encouraged the process of direct observation from primary sources, recording, analyzing and two/three dimensional development. Studies were expected in any suitable color, medium, process or technique. My work included studies of Andy Warhol's paintings and silk screens, concentrating also on the impact of music on visual art and vice versa. This included the effect of music icons as well as the music itself, reflecting on the dilemma and trouble which lie underneath the surface of human skin. Besides all that mentioned above, I have also experimented book jacket covers, posters collages and linoleum prints in multiple colors.
