Well, the reason why everyone isn't doing this is because this setup isn't made for everyone. Not every student will succeed at an online course. How do you know if you are or aren't the type that can handle it? Well, let's think about it. An online course involves taking courses online. (Really, I'm going somewhere with this. Stay tuned.) This means that you are studying on your own, without either classmates or teacher in the same room as yourself. This means two things. It means that you have no one around you to distract you, but you also have no one doing interesting and active things at the front of the classroom for you to focus on, or to engage the class and ensure that everyone is following the lesson. (Okay, three things.) While the lack of distracting classmates may seem a boon to a student with a short attention span, remember that you will be taking the class at home instead, where there are infinitely more distractions. So that may not even be an up side, unless you live alone and have the willpower not to turn on the TV or go make popcorn during the boring bits.
