While the Southern tradition values physical courage, Harper Lee seems to be suggesting that it is moral courage that deserves to be valued. The relationship of Finch family with Mrs. Dubose is the first instance in the book to show us true meaning of moral courage. Mrs. Dubose was an ill, harsh lady, who annoyed the children by insulting Atticus and his defending a Negro. Scout herself was so scared of Mrs. Dubose that she thought her father was the bravest man in the world as he dared to speak to her. After Jem beheaded Mrs. Dubose's camellia due to an outbreak of anger, he was forced to go and read for her. He and Scout were both scared of her dark creepy house, but both of them went to her house everyday after school to fulfil task. The children were extremely brave, especially little Scout. For Jem, it was a duty, but for Scout, to go to Mrs. Dubose's house was a choice of will, and she decided to accompany Jem anyway. Hence, moral courage is portrayed from the children's responsible act.
