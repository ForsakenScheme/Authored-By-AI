In "Shooting an Elephant" and "Marrakech," George Orwell is a colonizer. In "A Hanging," Orwell is a prisoner in Burma, and one of the colonized. One would think that this different perspective would somehow cure or lessen his prejudice, but that is not the case. This essay has two different levels of colonized people; the prisoners and the condemned. It begins with Orwell, along with other prisoners, being kept from breakfast because they first need to witness the hanging of a condemned man. Then as the condemned man approaches his soon to be execution site, he avoids stepping in a puddle, which Orwell sees, and realizes that the condemned man is no different than him. Orwell then realizes "what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man," and the consequences that follow. This is a sign that Orwell might somehow be lessening his prejudice, and changing his views. But Orwell is unable to mask his prejudice and describes a "jolly scene, after the hanging," and says that "one felt an impulse to sing" and that everyone was "chattering gaily." As Orwell and the prisoners walk towards the gates of the prison, Francis, one of the prisoners, tells the guard a story about another condemned man. Francis described how the guards had to pull on both legs to get the condemned man out of his cell. Orwell "found that [he] was laughing quite loudly" without any thought to the horrific feelings that the man had to be feeling, and the fact that he was about to be executed. Although Orwell is not the colonizer, he still separates himself from the men who are to be executed.
