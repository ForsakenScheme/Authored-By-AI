The final part of writing an essay is revision. Once the rough draft is written set it aside for a few days or hours. Proofread the rough draft. Have you used transitions? What type of voice are you using? Are there any spelling or grammar mistakes? Read the rough draft out loud and listen to any major mistakes. Have a friend read the essay. It is recommended to rewrite an essay at least three times.
