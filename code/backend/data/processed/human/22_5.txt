There is no doubt that George Orwell is a great renowned writer. His books and essays continue to be analyzed and studied by students everywhere, but the terms he uses, and the generalizations he makes about the colonized in these essays, are prejudice. He uses the death of a man as an alibi so that he is not punished for killing a man's livelihood. He dehumanizes the colonized in order to classify himself as a human of importance. He calls the poor colonized workers "coolies," and ridicules Jewish people. Orwell might not have seen himself as prejudice, but his words, humor, and the manner in which he writes portray a different story.
