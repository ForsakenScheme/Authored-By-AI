Some professors repeat something a couple of times in their lectures. Other professors give hints to guide the student in writing main points down. Often important points can be noted in the tone of the professor's voice. For instance, the instructor may raise his voice and then lower it back to his normal tone. When he raises his voice, he is giving a hint that this is important. When taking notes, watch the nonverbal communication of the professor and then listen to what he is saying.
