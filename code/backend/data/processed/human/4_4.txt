Begin writing your dissertation proposal. This is like writing a research paper with the literature review, the research project that you plan to do, and showing why your topic is worthy to be researched. Think about the variables that will be part of the research. What experiments, case studies, or other parts of the proposal are needed? Talk to your advisor about your topic. Check out other dissertations and read them so you have a better picture of what is needed.
