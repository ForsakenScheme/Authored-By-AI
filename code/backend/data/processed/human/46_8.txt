Business executives also try to minimise the impact of the merger or acquisition on the day-to-day operations of the resultant organisation(s) from the process so that business processes/functions are not adversely affected, down-times are not experienced and customers are not inconvenienced (Siemens, 2004). Apart from people, IT infrastructure is the largest investment for most organisations and is a critical strategic asset for improvement (Worthen, 2002). An organisation's merger and acquisition intent (to increase scale, expand breadth or drive efficiencies) will determine the IT requirements for the resultant organisation(s) (Cullen, 2006).
