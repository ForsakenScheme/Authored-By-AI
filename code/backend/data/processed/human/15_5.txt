The Enlightenment, in my opinion is just that, a formation of identity for Europe and modern Western society form the rest of the world. Through experiences a person slowly defines their identity becoming more autonomous in the process. Europe had these experiences intrinsically on the continent and within countries, but experienced the rest of the world through traveling, conquering and colonizing, taking an active part rather than merely observing. This is also usually the case in adolescence. To fully experience their musical talent lets say, an adolescent can't merely watch the school band play, but must actively participate in order to determine and asses their own experience as part of their identity, who they "are".
