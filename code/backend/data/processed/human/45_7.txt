Even though Road to Perdition is the title it pretty much explains the final outcome of the movie, at least for those that know the definition of perdition. The story on getting there is a grasping drama that pulls you in, even if you're not a movie lover. This movie is an excellent adaptation towards the bonds of father and son and homage to a Shakespearian Tragedy. Road to Perdition won an Academy Award for Best Cinematography as well as 17 other awards and 47 nominations. So it goes without me saying, "This is a movie you must watch!" You wouldn't be disappointed if you went out to Blockbuster and rented this movie to watch on a boring Thursday night.
