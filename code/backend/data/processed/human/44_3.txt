If Oedipus had never become even somewhat aware of the truth, he could have stayed blissfully ignorant, and away from fulfilling his destiny. Also, if Oedipus had been aware of the full truth from the beginning, it is easy to say that he could have avoided his fate. Thus so, Sophocles gives another hint: one is only safe from their fate when they are either completely aware of it, or completely blind to it.
