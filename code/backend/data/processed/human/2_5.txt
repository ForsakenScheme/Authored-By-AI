So what type of person SHOULD consider online study? Well, if you enjoy studying independently, if you would rather go at your own pace, and if you do not need a great deal of supervision or interaction, then an online course would be ideal for you. There are many students out there who, in fact, are self-motivated. There are plenty of students who would rather study and learn on their own time than in a classroom full of people asking questions. And there are plenty of students who would learn better without a professor who likes to ask if everyone "gets it." If you are of this type, then online study may be ideal for you.
